# JupiterOne 2019.21 Release

2019-04-30

## New Features

- **Alerts** app updated and released with the following capabilities:

    - New UX that combines alerts and findings management into one app
    - Updated UI for creating/editing alert rules
    - Ability to import alert rule packs. See available rule packs at:
      <https://github.com/JupiterOne/jupiterone-alert-rules/>
    - Receive daily email notifications of active/new alerts

- Updated **JupiterOne Client and CLI** to support managing custom questions.
  
    - Custom questions will show up in the Question/Query Library.
    - They can be access via keywords search in the Landing app.
    - They will also be mapped to compliance requirements in the Compliance app,
      if the question is configured with a corresponding mapping.

- Ability to **enable API Key access** for one or more user groups to allow the
  users to generate API keys used for the external client or CLI.

- Simplified and improved **full text search**:

    - You no longer have to wrap keywords in quotes to perform a full text search

    - Partial keywords search is supported -- property value index is updated to
      tokenize on capital letters as well as common non-space non-alphanumeric
      characters

    - Cross-field matching in supported -- search will return results that match
      keywords across any property of a particular entity. For example:

        - searching `administrator policy` will match an entity with
          `_class: Policy` and `name: AdministratorAccess` in two different
          properties

        - searching `prod instance` will match entities with `_type: aws_instance`
          and `tag.AccountName: jupiterone-prod-us` properties

- **J1QL shorthand comparison for property filters**. For example, you can type

    ```j1ql
    Find DataStore with classification=('confidential' or 'restricted')
    ```

    instead of

    ```j1ql
    Find DataStore with classification='confidential' or classification='restricted'
    ```

- **Jamf** integration initial release. See details at
  <https://support.jupiterone.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022721134-Jamf>

- **Tenable Cloud** integration initial release. See details at
  <https://support.jupiterone.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022902593-Tenable-Cloud>

- **AWS EC2 Auto Scaling** supported added to the AWS integration. Here are two
  example queries that will allow you to find instances that are / are not part
  of an auto-scaling group.

    ```j1ql
    Find aws_instance that has aws_autoscaling_group

    Find aws_instance that !has aws_autoscaling_group
    ```
