## Integrations

### Google Cloud

We recently discovered some ineffective relationships were being created between the `google_iam_role` and several entities, 
which may be causing the reporting of incorrect permissions in queries.

To correct this issue, we added a `google_iam_binding` entity to the Google Cloud integration that better represents how 
your permissions are associated with principals in Google Cloud.

#### What has changed?

- Added support for ingesting the following new entity:

| Resource           | Entity `_type`       | Entity `_class` |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------- |
| IAM Binding        | `google_iam_binding` | `AccessPolicy` |

- Added support for ingesting the following new relationships:

| Source Entity `_type`      | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type`               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `google_iam_binding`       | **ASSIGNED**          | `google_iam_service_account`        |
| `google_iam_binding`       | **ASSIGNED**          | `google_user`                       |
| `google_iam_binding`       | **ASSIGNED**          | `google_group`                      |
| `google_iam_binding`       | **ASSIGNED**          | `google_domain`                     |
| `google_iam_binding`       | **ASSIGNED**          | `google_iam_role`                   |
| `google_iam_binding`       | **ASSIGNED**          | `everyone`                          |
| `google_iam_binding`       | **ASSIGNED**          | `google_cloud_authenticated_users`  |
| `google_iam_binding`       | **USES**              | `google_iam_role`                   |
| `google_iam_binding`       | **ALLOWS**            | `ANY_RESOURCE`                      |
| `google_cloud_api_service` | **HAS**               | `ANY_RESOURCE`                      |

- Removed the following relationships:

| Source Entity `_type`              | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type`  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `google_user`                      | **ASSIGNED**          | `google_iam_role`      |
| `google_group`                     | **ASSIGNED**          | `google_iam_role`      |
| `google_domain`                    | **ASSIGNED**          | `google_iam_role`      |
| `everyone`                         | **ASSIGNED**          | `google_iam_role`      |
| `google_cloud_authenticated_users` | **ASSIGNED**          | `google_iam_role`      |
| `google_iam_service_account`       | **ASSIGNED**          | `google_iam_role`      |

- `google_iam_binding` ingestion now takes place in the `fetch-iam-bindings` step instead of the 
`fetch-resource-manager-iam-policy` step, which is removed. If an integration does not use the 
configure organization projects option in the configuration, this step uses the project scope 
to fetch IAM policies.

#### Customer Impact

As a result of these changes, please be aware of the following:

- For the integration to properly ingest the IAM bindings, the Cloud Asset API (cloudasset.googleapis.com) 
must be enabled in your Google Cloud account. If this API is not enabled, the step that imports the IAM 
bindings is omitted during ingestion. For additional details on enabling the Cloud Asset API, see 
the [J1 Documentation](https://github.com/JupiterOne/graph-google-cloud/blob/main/docs/jupiterone.md#in-google-cloud) 
and the [Google Cloud Documentation](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudasset.googleapis.com).

- Traversal queries in J1 that previously queried a relationship directly between the `google_iam_role` and 
the principal member of your Google account must now go through the `google_iam_binding_entity`. For example, 
`Find google_user ASSIGNED google_iam_role` must change to `Find google_user that ASSIGNED google_iam_binding 
that USES google_iam_role`.

- The following queries in the question library are updated based on these changes:
  - “Ensure that IAM users are not assigned the Service Account User or Service Account Token Creator roles at project level"
  - “Ensure that Service Account has no Admin privileges”

## Integrations

### AWS

- Fixed validation error when supplying empty array to `macie2.getFindings` API.

- Added `cluster` parameter to `describeContainerInstances` to address AWS 
  notice of validation changes that began on September 24, 2021.

- Added support for ingesting the following additional properties on `aws_instance` entities:
  - `metadataOptionsState`, `httpTokens`, `httpPutResponseHopLimit`, `httpEndpointEnabled`, 
    `enclaveOptionsEnabled`, `hibernationOptionsConfigured`.

### Azure

- Improved handling of errors caused by disabled Azure accounts.

- Improved handling of some errors to better communicate the cause of the error.

### Cloudflare

- Migrated the integration to the latest SDK and infrastructure to allow 
  extended execution time on very large accounts.

- Improved handling and reporting of authentication and authorization errors to users.

### GitHub

- With this update, J1 has requested read-only access to GitHub Organization Secrets, 
  GitHub Repository Secrets, and environment secrets metadata, which must be granted 
  in the JupiterOne app in GitHub. 
  
  Read-only access allows J1 to access information about the secrets, but not the 
  encrypted values. J1 has no access to the values of secrets at any time, 
  nor will J1 request such access.
  
  This access enables you to ask questions in J1 about your secrets, such as 
  "What Secrets are older than 365 days?" or "Which Repos have access to Org Secrets?" or 
  "Are there instances where Repo Secrets override Org Secrets of the same name?"
  
  For more information on GitHub Secrets, review the GitHub documentation 
  about the controls in place with this access:
  
  - Secrets: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#secrets

  - Get an organization secret: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#get-an-organization-secret

  - Get a repository secret: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#get-a-repository-secret
  
  - Get an environment secret: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#get-an-environment-secret 
  
  If existing GitHub integration users do not grant these additional permissions 
  in their GitHub account, J1 automatically omits these steps in the integration and 
  does not import the organization and repository secret entities and properties. The rest 
  of the data for already approved permissions continue to be imported into J1 as expected.  
  
  New users of the GitHub integration in J1 are required to approve these permissions 
  to use the integration.
  
- Added support for ingesting the following new entities:

| Resources          | Entity `_type`       | Entity `_class` |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------- |
| GitHub Environment | `github_environment` | `Configuration` |
| GitHub Env Secret  | `github_env_secret`  | `Secret`        |

- Added support for ingesting the following new relationships:

| Source Entity `_type` | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type` |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `github_repo`         | **HAS**               | `github_environment`  |
| `github_environment`  | **HAS**               | `github_env_secret`   |
| `github_env_secret`   | **OVERRIDES**         | `github_org_secret`   |
| `github_env_secret`   | **OVERRIDES**         | `github_repo_secret`  |
| `github_repo`         | **USES**              | `github_env_secret`   |

- Added support for ingesting the following additional properties on `github_account` entities:
  - `createdOn`, `updatedOn`, `description`, `email`, `node`, `databaseId`, `isVerified`, `location`, `websiteUrl`, `webLink`

- Added support for ingesting the following additional properties on `github_team` entities:
  - `createdOn`, `updatedOn`, `databaseId`, `description`, `node`, `privacy`

- Added support for ingesting the following additional properties on `github_user` entities:
  - `company`, `createdOn`, `updatedOn`, `databaseId`, `node`, `isEmployee`, `location`, `websiteUrl`, `email`

- Added support for ingesting the following additional properties on `github_repo` entities:
  - `autoMergeAllowed`, `databaseId`, `deleteBranchOnMerge`, `description`, `homepageUrl`, `node`, `isDisabled`, 
    `isEmpty`, `isFork`, `isInOrganization`, `isLocked`, `isMirror`, `isSecurityPolicyEnabled`, `isTemplate`, 
    `isUserConfigurationRepository`, `lockReason`, `mergeCommitAllowed`, `pushedOn`, `rebaseMergeAllowed`

- Added support for ingesting the following additional properties on `github_pullrequest` entities:
  - `databaseId`, `node`, `commitsCount`, `approvalsCount`, `approvalLastAt`

- Pull requests that are opened, reviewed, or approved by a user who is not part of the
  current organization or collaborator list now have a mapped relationship to a
  GitHub user with the login recorded in the pull request properties.

- Fixed `createdOn` and `updatedOn` properties on `github_org_secret`, `github_repo_secret`, and `github_app` to be Unix timestamp integers.

- Fixed step failures caused by insufficient permissions (disallowed scopes).

#### GitHub Analyze Commit Approval Changes

The initial version of the J1 GitHub integration provided a configuration option to enable analyze commit approvals. This feature gives you 
the ability to see which users have opened, reviewed, and/or approved a pull request in their GitHub account.

 ![](../assets/graph-github-analyze-commit-approval.png)

 The `analyzeCommitApproval` step in the integration generates the following relationships in the graph:

  | Source Entity `_type` | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type` |
  | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
  | `github_user`         | **OPENED**            | `github_pullrequest`    |
  | `github_user`         | **REVIEWED**          | `github_pullrequest`    |
  | `github_user`         | **APPROVED**          | `github_pullrequest`    |

  These entities appear in the graph, showing which users opened, reviewed, and/or approved a pull request in GitHub:

  ![](../assets/graph-github-pullreques-data-model.png)

Initially, this feaure was an optional setting because in large GitHub accounts it could result in API throttling for 
a GitHub account. J1 has recently made updates to include this information as part of the data imported to J1, with no 
adverse effect on your API usage. Because of this improvement to the integration, this data is now included in all 
GitHub integrations, regardless of the setting in the configuration UI. A future update will remove this setting from the UI.

 **Customer Impact**

If you had already enabled this setting in your GitHub configurations, it continues to behave the same after J1 updates the UI.

If you did not enable this setting due to API throttling concerns, you now have additional GitHub data available in your 
J1 account with no adverse effect on your GitHub API usage. 

The option to ingest pull requests also exists in the J1 Bitbucket integration, however, there is no change in its behavior. 
It is still an option that you can choose to enable or not.

### Google Cloud

- Fixed `UNABLE_TO_FIND_PROJECT_ID` error.

- Moved J1-managed questions into the [open source `graph-google-cloud`](https://github.com/JupiterOne/graph-google-cloud/tree/main/jupiterone/questions) project.
  You are welcome to create pull requests!

- Fixed missing `Internet` **ALLOWS** `google_compute_firewall` relationships for
  `0.0.0.0/0`/`::/0` source CIDR blocks.
