# JupiterOne 2019.24 Release

2019-06-11

## New Features

- Query language now supports **group by aggregates** based on entity attributes
  in addition to relationships. For example, try:

    ```j1ql
    // Count number of pull requests by repo and then state

    Find PR as pr
      return pr.repository, pr.state, count(pr)
    ```

    or

    ```j1ql
    // Count unencrypted data stores by type

    Find DataStore with encrypted=false as ds
      return ds._type, count(ds) as value
    ```

- Updated **AWS GuardDuty** integration to better support threat analysis by
  parsing the threat intel list and attack source details. Try:

    ```j1ql
    Find Finding as f return f.threatList, count(f)
    ```

    or

    ```j1ql
    Find Finding as f return f.attackSource, count(f)
    ```

- **Alerts Trend and History Data**:

  Each alert now displays a **trend chart** to visualize changes over time.
  Selecting a data point on the trend chart will show you the results data
  captured by the alert at that point in time.

- Added capabilities in **Compliance** app that
  
    - allows you to import/upload any compliance framework, including your own
      custom security controls and best practices;

    - performs automated **continuous gap analysis** based on matching queries;

    - shows improved indicators to show status of *policies*,
      *evidence collected*, and *gap analysis outcome*; and

    - maps policies, procedures and evidences to **controls** in addition to
      requirements.

  search strings to quick filter results based on entity property values.
