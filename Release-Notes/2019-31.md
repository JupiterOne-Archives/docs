# JupiterOne 2019.31 Release

2019-10-14

_This past two weeks was another one of those sprints where we focused mostly on code and infrastructure improvements (aka 'tech debts')._

## New Features

- You can see all the question tags at once and easily **filter by tags** from
  the Query Library:

  ![query-library-tags-filter](../assets/query-library-tags-filter.png)

- Improved mapping with between policy controls/procedures, query questions and
  compliance requirements. You will be prompted to run mapping for security
  requirements when you add a compliance standard object, if there is no
  existing mappings at the requirements level.

- Compliance evidence download now includes **policy procedures mapping** as
  well as **user provided evidence links and notes** in the package, in addition
  to query outputs.

## Integrations

- **AWS**

  - Fixed an issue where S3 bucket permission to AWS global authenticated users
    (`http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers`) was not parsed
    and mapped.
  
  - Captured `renewalEligibility` property to `aws_acm_certificate` entities.

  - Split processing of IAM policy permissions and IAM role trusts to separate
    steps to avoid timeout that happened in accounts with large number of IAM
    policies.

- **Azure**

  - Added support to configure multiple integration instances (i.e. Azure
    subscriptions).
  
  - Also added an option to enable/disable Active Directory data ingestion for a
    particular integration instance.
  
  - Captured tags and `resourceGroup` property on compute resources, and other
    minor improvements.

- **Github**: captured `archived` property on repos.

- First iteration of **JumpCloud** integration is released. This release ingests
  users and user groups from connected JumpCloud account.
  
  See [JumpCloud integration docs][docs-jumpcloud] for more details.

## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Fixed a parsing error with multi-line queries on Windows systems because of
  the `\r` character

- Fixed a couple of data loading and UI issues with alerts.

- Fixed a navigation issue when creating a new integration instance -- instead
  of being navigated back to the list of configurations, you will stay on the
  integration instance page and will be prompted to run the integration for the
  first time.

- Fixed a scrolling issue with Docs in Query Library.

- Various backend and infrastructure improvements.
