  without opening the question editor to edit the mapping.

## Integrations

### AWS

* Added support to capture S3 object-level logging and Lambda function logging enabled via CloudTrail

  > This requires the `cloudtrail:GetEventSelectors` permission to be added to the IAM policy attached
  > to the JupiterOne integration IAM role, if you are not using the AWS managed `SecurityAudit` policy.

* Added `webLink` to `aws_cloudtrail` entities
* Added `webLink` to `aws_cloudtrail - LOGS -> aws_s3_bucket` relationships
* Added `webLink` to `aws_cloudtrail - LOGS -> aws_cloudwatch_log_group` relationships
* Added `aws_s3_bucket_object_logging - SENDS -> aws_s3` relationships
* Added `aws_lambda_function_logging - SENDS -> aws_lambda` relationships
* Added `aws_s3_bucket_object_logging - SENDS -> aws_s3_bucket` relationships
* Added `aws_lambda_function_logging - SENDS -> aws_lambda_function` relationships
* Added additional queries to managed question "Is CloudTrail logging enabled?" using those new relationships

  resource ingestion. This is useful when you only want to ingest Azure AD configuration.

* Added `duo_integration` entities

* Fixed `duo_group_has_user` relationship was not working correctly

### Fastly

* Steps are enabled or disabled based on role of configured Fastly user account

## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Significant performance improvement to the `security-policy-builder` CLI tool.
  It will also delete orphaned policies/procedures that were not part of the latest publish.
  To upgrade to the latest version, run:

  ```bash
  npm upgrade -g @jupiterone/security-policy-builder@latest
  ```

- Resolved an issue where deleting an api key would throw an error in the UI

- Fixed an issue where deleted entities were showing up in all queries and were also not formatted correctly

- Markdown can now render markdown inside of admonitions in the policies app

- Fixed an issue causing insights to load with the wrong url

- Fixed an issue where insights board would be loaded without a layout

- Added failed request retry logic so all parts of the app should hopefully be a bit more resilient now

- Fixed an issue where incorrectly formatted queries would not give a helpful error message

- Fixed an issue where compliance standards would show duplicates in the UI
