- New ingestion and analysis from **AWS**:

    - **AWS Transfer for SFTP** servers and users. Try this query:
    
      ```j1ql
      Find aws_account
        that HAS aws_transfer
        that HAS Host
        that HAS User
        that RELATES TO *
        return tree
      ```

- **Carbon Black PSC and Defense Sensor integration** released - ingests sensor
  agents, policies, and relationships indicating which sensor is assigned which
  policy. Also maps the sensors to end-user devices and the device owner. See
  [docs][carbon-black-psc-doc] for more details.

  Try these queries:

    ```j1ql
    Find cbdefense_sensor that PROTECTS Device

    Find Person
      that OWNS Device
      that PROTECTS cbdefense_sensor
    ```

- **OneLogin integration** released - ingests users, user groups, applications
  and their relationships. Similar to the Okta integration, this allows you to
  easily query and visualize *who has access to what* within your identity and
  access configuration and the connections to the rest of your digital
  infrastructure. See [docs][onelogin-doc] for more details.

## Improvements and Bug Fixes
