# JupiterOne 2019.29 Release

2019-09-10

## New Features

- Added support in J1QL for **(not) contains** `~=` (`!~=`), **(not) starts
  with** `^=` (`!^=`), and **(not) ends with** `$=` (`!$=`) string comparison in
  property filters

- Redesign and refactor of the **Landing** app: moved **Library** to side panel
  so that it can remain open side-by-side when running queries

- Added an option to **include recently deleted data** when running search and
  queries.

- Graph view of query result now **auto-remembers node positions** as you adjust
  the layout of the graph view (for admin users); node positions are loaded
  subsequently when the same query is executed (for all users).

## Integrations

_Starting with this release note, we are putting integration related updates
together in this section._

- **AWS**

  - Added support for **EBS snapshot**, **RDS snapshot**, **Classic ELB**,
    **Route53 registered domain**, **S3 bucket inventory configuration**, and
    **CloudFormation stacks**.

  - Fixed a couple of API pagination issues

  - Updated permission flags on IAM policy and S3 bucket policy permission
    relationships

  - Updated to ensure accuracy and consistency of the `name` and `id` properties
