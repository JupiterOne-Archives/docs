# AirWatch Integration with JupiterOne

## VMWare AirWatch + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

*   Visualize VMWare AirWatch admins, users, groups, and devices in the
    JupiterOne graph.
*   Map VMWare AirWatch users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
*   Monitor changes to VMWare AirWatch admins, users, groups, and devices
    using JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

*   JupiterOne periodically fetches users and devices from VMWare AirWatch
    to update the graph.
*   Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph,
    or leverage existing queries.
*   Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes,
    or leverage existing alerts.

## Requirements

*   JupiterOne requires a VMWare AirWatch hostname, admin username and password,
    and rest API key to interact with the API.
*   You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Integration Walkthrough

### In VMWare AirWatch

After logging into VMWare AirWatch (Workspace ONE™️ UEM), create an
Administrator user account for the integration to authenticate with the REST
API.

1.  Select **Accounts** > **Administrators** > **List View**.

2.  Press the **Add** > **Add Admin**" button and provide required details. It is
    *recommended* that you set values representing JupiterOne as a system user
    account. It is *important* that you set *Title* on the *Details* tab to
    "system" so that JupiterOne understands this is a user for automation (it
    will not attempt to map to a Person entity).

3.  Once the account is created, navigate to **Groups & Settings** > **All
    Settings** > **System** > **Advanced** > **API** > **REST API**" and click
    **Add** to create a new API key.

### In JupiterOne

1.  From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2.  Scroll to the **VMWare AirWatch** integration tile and click it.
3.  Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

*   Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this VMWare AirWatch
    account in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
    `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
*   Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
    the integration instance.
*   Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
    needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
*   Enter the **Hostname** of your VMWare AirWatch account.
*   Enter the **Admin Username** used to authenticate with VMWare Airwatch.
*   Enter the **Admin Password** associated with the username.
*   Enter the **Rest API Key** (or Tenant Code) used to authenticate with
    VMWare Airwatch.

4.  Click **Create Configuration** once all values are provided.

## How to Uninstall

2.  Scroll to the **VMWare AirWatch** integration tile and click it.
3.  Identify and click the **integration to delete**.
4.  Click the **trash can** icon.
5.  Click the **Remove** button to delete the integration.
