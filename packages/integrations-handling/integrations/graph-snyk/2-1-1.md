# Integration with JupiterOne

## Snyk + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

*   Visualize Snyk code repositories and findings in the JupiterOne graph.
*   Monitor Snyk findings within the alerts app.
*   Monitor changes to Snyk code repositories using JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

*   JupiterOne periodically fetches Snyk repositories and findings to update the
    graph.
*   Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
*   Configure alerts to reduce the noise of findings.
*   Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes.

## Requirements

*   JupiterOne requires the organisation id where your Snyk projects reside as
    well as the API Key configured to authenticate with Snyk.
*   You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Support

## Integration Walkthrough

## In Snyk

The integration instance configurations requires the following two parameters:

*   **Snyk API Key** (`snykApiKey`) In Snyk: In the upper right hand corner mouse
    over your account name, where a drop down will appear. Click on
    `account settings` and your API token will appear in a hidden form in the
    middle of the page. Click show and copy your key.

*   **Snyk Organisation ID** (`snykOrgId`) In Snyk: Go to the dashboard. Click on
    `manage organisation` on the far right of the screen across from `Dashboard`.
    Here, your organisation ID is displayed.

### In JupiterOne

1.  From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2.  Scroll to the **Snyk** integration tile and click it.
3.  Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

*   Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this Snyk account
    in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
    `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
*   Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
    the integration instance.
*   Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
    needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
*   Enter the **API Key** used to authenticate with Snyk.
*   Enter the **Organisation ID** your Snyk projects reside in.

4.  Click **Create Configuration** once all values are provided.

## How to Uninstall

1.  From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2.  Scroll to the **Snyk** integration tile and click it.
3.  Identify and click the **integration to delete**.
4.  Click the **trash can** icon.
5.  Click the **Remove** button to delete the integration.
