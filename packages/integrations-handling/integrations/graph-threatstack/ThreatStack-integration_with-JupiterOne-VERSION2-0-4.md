## Integration Walkthrough

### In Threat Stack

The integration instance configuration requires the following parameters for API
authentication:

of them into your integration configuration screen in JupiterOne.

*   **Organization Name** (`orgName`)

*   Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
    the integration instance.
