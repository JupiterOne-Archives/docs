Metadata
========

The standard metadata properties of a given entity/relationship. These properties are system generated (e.g. set by an integration).  They are viewable in the UI but not directly editable by a user.

``_accountId`` (string) - Required
----------------------------------

The account / tenant identifier

``_id`` (string) - Required
---------------------------

An auto-generated and globally unique ID

``_key`` (string) - Required
----------------------------

A unique identifier of an entity/relationship within the scope of a single integration instance. For example, for a Bitbucket repo, this _id will be the GUID of the repo as assigned by Bitbucket. For an IAM Role, the _id will be the ARN of the role.

``__iconPath`` (string) - Optional
----------------------------------

Path to the icon used in the web app UI

``_class`` (string) - Required
------------------------------

Used to create an abstract security data model. For example, a EC2 instance will have '_class':'Host'. An integration can supply one or more classes which can be used to indicate if a particular entity/relationship conforms to one or more standard classifications. This property is similar to _type except that _class refers to a type that has been standardized while _type is an entity type that only has to be unique in the scope of the provider. It is possible that an entity/relationship has a _type value but no _class value in cases where there is no standard classification for a given entity/relationship.

``_type`` (string) - Required
-----------------------------

Describes the type of entity/relationship as identified by the data source (often the integration or sometimes manual user input). The _class property is similar to _type but _class refers to a categorization that has been standardized and it is not unique to a single data integration.

``_integrationName`` (string) - Optional
----------------------------------------

Name of the integration that created this entity.

``_integrationDefinitionId`` (string) - Optional
------------------------------------------------

The unique ID of the integration definition that created this entity.

``_integrationInstanceId`` (string) - Optional
----------------------------------------------

The unique ID of the integration instance that created this entity.

``_createdOn`` (number) - Required
----------------------------------

The timestamp (in milliseconds since epoch) when this node was created - the earliest timestamp for this entity as known by the security platform (might be different from when entity was actually created in external system)

Format: date-time

``_createdBy`` (string) - Optional
----------------------------------

The entityId of the user who created this node, if it is created manually and not by an integration.

``_beginOn`` (number) - Required
--------------------------------

The timestamp (in milliseconds since epoch) when this node was updated

Format: date-time

``_endOn`` (number) - Optional
------------------------------

The timestamp (in milliseconds since epoch) when a new version of this node was created

Format: date-time

``_updatedBy`` (string) - Optional
----------------------------------

The entityId of the user who last updated this node, if it is created manually and not by an integration.

``_lastSeenOn`` (number) - Required
-----------------------------------

The timestamp (in milliseconds since epoch) when this node was last seen in events/logs or other ingested data sources

Format: date-time

``_version`` (integer) - Required
---------------------------------

Numerical auto-incrementing value that represents the version number of this node. Increments every time the node is updated.

``_latest`` (boolean) - Optional
--------------------------------

Indicates if this node is the latest version of the Entity.

``_deleted`` (boolean) - Optional
---------------------------------

Indicates if this node is soft-deleted.

``_source`` (string) - Required
-------------------------------

Indicates source of this node.

``vendorManaged`` (boolean) - Optional
--------------------------------------

Indicates if this entity/relationship is managed by the vendor.

``inUse`` (boolean) - Optional
------------------------------

Indicates if this entity/relationship is in use.

``ignore`` (boolean) - Optional
-------------------------------

Instructs the query to ignore this entity/relationship by default.
