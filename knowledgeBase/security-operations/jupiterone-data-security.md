# JupiterOne Data Security

This document describes in detail the data JupiterOne ingests and how your data
is protected on our platform.

## Data Protection

### Encryption

Data is fully encrypted both at rest and in transit. This includes all of your
account and user data, as well as operational data imported/ingested into the
JupiterOne platform.

**Data in Transit** is encrypted via TLSv1.2 or later, using SHA-256 with
2048-bit RSA Encryption or equivalent strength cypher.

_Production Domains:_ `*.apps.us.jupiterone.io` is the associated production
URL that the SSL/TLS certificate has been issued to.

**Data at Rest** is hosted in our production AWS environments, using the managed
RDS/Neptune, DynamoDB, and S3 services. All database instances, tables, and S3
buckets with customer data have server-side encryption enabled, using AWS KMS
for key management. KMS encryption keys are scheduled to rotate annually.

In addition to encryption, managed backup is enabled for the database clusters.
For S3 buckets, cross-account replication is enabled to back up data to a
different region for disaster recovery. All backup data is fully encrypted the
same way as its source.

### Multi-tenancy

JupiterOne is a multi-tenancy, software-as-a-service platform hosted in AWS.
Customer data is logically partitioned/segregated by software via a unique
`accountId` associated with every piece of data. Access to data is restricted to
within each unique account for users granted proper access to that account. This
is a standard pattern used by cloud infrastructure and SaaS providers.

## External Data Ingestion/Import

JupiterOne ingests data from external sources and connected environments
primarily via the APIs provided by the target environment/service provider.
Objects from these external environments and their corresponding metadata,
including configuration properties and tags but never the actual data content,
are ingested as "entities". The entity properties and tags are used to perform
analysis to build out "relationships" among ingested entities. These entities
and relationships are the **JupiterOne CORE data model**.

JupiterOne then uses this data model to inventory for and provide insight into
your digital infrastructure across all of your connected environments.

More information on the JupiterOne data model is available [here](../jupiterone-data-model.md).

For more details on data ingested for each managed integration, see their
corresponding documentation in the **Integrations** section.

### Access Permissions Needed to Integrated Environments

Access to your environments is needed in order to ingest data, or to enable
workflow automation (future capability).

In general, JupiterOne only requires read-only, security-auditor-type access
permissions to your environments. Additionally, this read-only access only
applies to configurations and meta data, not the actual data content. For
example, we do **NOT** read S3 objects data from a connected AWS account, or the
actual source code of a connected Bitbucket/GitHub account.

Additional level of access may be needed for workflow automation. For example,
integration with Jira to automatically create an issue when a new Vulnerability
finding is added; or to post to a Slack channel/user to send a security alert
notification.

You are always in control of the actual permissions granted for each
integration. More details of the access permissions required for each managed
integration can be found in its corresponding documentation listed above.

### Custom Data Import

Additionally, JupiterOne supports the ability for you to add custom data by

- Manually adding entities via Web UI in the Asset Inventory app;
- Adding bulk number of entities via CSV import; or
- Adding custom entities via custom integrations using the public API.

## Data Ownership and Access

You retain full ownership of all data that is ingested via integrations, API or
manual importing/creation. Data is stored in the JupiterOne production environment
in AWS, protected via encryption and replication as specified in the first
section.

### Infrastructure and Operational Access

JupiterOne infrastructure is built on a **Zero Trust** security model, where
access to production is _highly restricted_.

The production environment is virtually "air-gapped" such that there is no SSH,
"bastion host", or VPN connectivity into the production systems to prevent
unintended network access to databases and other production servers. We do not
allow internal access to production data by any JupiterOne team member. All
necessary operational support and maintenance jobs are performed via automation
where the automation code is fully documented, reviewed, and approved, ensuring
end-to-end traceability.

Our production environment incorporates multiple layers of security monitoring,
using JupiterOne itself as well as third party security solutions. Additionally,
our software development includes rigorous code analysis and continuous testing
practices to ensure we proactively identify any security vulnerability. Our
infrastructure-as-code operational model and automated change management process
allows us to deploy security patches within minutes of identification and
remediation of an issue.

You can review the JupiterOne [data model](../jupiterone-data-model.md) and [policies and procedures](https://psp.jptr.one/) for
more details on the JupiterOne operational, infrastructure, and software
development security.

## Application Access

Access to the JupiterOne application and your accounts/data on the platform is
enabled over HTTPS, through either the JupiterOne web apps or the public APIs.

!!! note
`*.us.jupiterone.io` is the current production domain.

### User Logins

Each user has a unique user login to the JupiterOne platform and apps. Users
may be invited to one or multiple organizational accounts on JupiterOne.

#### Password Policy

Users are required to select a strong password that meets the following password
policy requirements to create a login and authenticate to the system:

- Minimum of 8 characters
- Must contain an uppercase letter
- Must contain a lowercase letter
- Must contain a number
- Must contain a special character

#### Single Sign-On (SSO)

JupiterOne currently supports single sign-on (SSO) via:

- Google
- SAML

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) / Two-Step Verification (2SV)

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Two-Step Verification (2SV) is strongly
recommended for all users on the JupiterOne platform. This needs to be enabled
and configured via your SSO provider (Google or your SAML IdP such as Okta or
OneLogin).

### Access Control

To support potential complex access control use cases, the JupiterOne
platform implements Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC).

A good general overview of ABAC is sections 1 and 2 of NIST's [Guide to
Attribute Based Access Control][nist-abac]. The absolute basics of ABAC are that
you have a subject (e.g. a user) who wants to perform some operation (e.g.
download) on an object (e.g. a file) in some environment. The subject, object
and environment all have attributes (i.e. key/value pairs), and there are
policies that control the privileges (i.e. what operations the subject can
perform) given the attributes.

[nist-abac]: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-162/final

Access policies defined in JupiterOne are associated with a **User Group** and
**Users** are invited/added as members to one or more groups.

- A _Read-Only_ access policy is predefined and associated with the default
  **Users** group.
- A _Full-Access_ policy is also predefined and associated with the default
  **Administrators** group.
- The ability to customize and add granular access control policies is to be
  released in 1Q2019.

### API Access

JupiterOne API is available at: https://api.us.jupiterone.io/

We use [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) for authorization, which means in order
to access data a user must authenticate and the requesting app must be
authorized. Implicit grant, authorization code, and client credentials flows are
supported. Authorization code is recommended for web apps, which involves
utilizing both the authorize and token API resources. When using the
authorization code grant flow, it is also recommended to use Proof Key for Code
Exchange (PCKE) to mitigate authorization code intercept attacks. Contact us if
building a native app which can securely perform client credentials flow.

Additionally, each user on the platform can create an API key that can be passed
along with request to act on behalf of that user.

### Support Access to Your JupiterOne Account(s)

A JupiterOne Support User can be added to any account to assist with a
proof-of-concept evaluation, help with initial onboarding, or facilitate support
and training on using the platform. Any users that have access to your
JupiterOne account will show up in Settings under _Users and Access_.

- The Security Engineer/Architect designated to your account (support user) will
  appear as `firstname.lastname@jupiterone.com`.
- The support user can be removed by an account administrator at any time,
  should you determine that ongoing regular support is no longer needed.
- You have the option and administrative privilege to add the support user back
  at any time, when support is needed in the future.
