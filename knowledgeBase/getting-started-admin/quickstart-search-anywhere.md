# Getting Started with JupiterOne

The JupiterOne (J1) Search Anything is the home page that gets you started as a 
new user or is the landing page for all other functions if you are a frequent user. 

## Configuring Your Account

When you first log in to your account, you can:

- [Enable the J1 Playground](#enabling-the-j1playground)
- [Ask questions](#asking-questions)
- [Add policies and procedures](#adding-policies-and-procedures)
- [Configure integrations](#configuring-Integrations)
- [Configure alerts](#configuring-alerts) 
- [Review the compliance standards](#reviewing-compliance-standards)

### Enabling the J1 Playground

As part of your onboarding resources, J1 provides a [sandbox account 
and demo data](quickstart-sample-data.md) to give you the opportunity to get familiar with J1 
before you start working with your organization data. Click the Resources
icon ![resourcesicon](../assets/icons/resources.png) and select **Onboarding**. In the top-right of the screen, click 
the sample data icon ![sampledata](../assets/icons/sample-data.png) and follow the instructions on the screen.

### Asking Questions

J1 catalogs all the questions asked in https://ask.us.jupiterone.io/ and provides
the associated J1 Query Language (J1QL) queries. Peruse the catalog to find
the answers to the frequently asked questions.

### Adding Policies and Procedures

To create corporate security [policies and procedures](../guides/manage-policies/policies-app.md) for your organization, use
the Polices app or the [Policies CLI tool](../guides/manage-policies/policy-builder-cli.md). You can generate policies and 
procedures from templates, manage them online via the webapp. You can also
map controls and procedures to the compliance requirements of your organization.

### Configuring Integrations

Before you can use all the rich features of J1, you must first configure an 
integration to pull in your organization data. J1 provides numerous 
[managed integrations](configure-integrations.md) and regularly adds more to the list. Each 
integration is ready for you to quickly implement and get started 
pulling your data into J1.

### Configuring Alerts

J1 enables you to [create alerts](manage-alerts.md) for continuous auditing and threat monitoring. 
Each alert must have at least one rule. You can import rules from a rule pack 
that J1 provides, or create your own custom rules.

### Reviewing Compliance Standards

JupiterOne provides a flexible platform for you to import and [manage any 
compliance standard or framework](../guides/compliance/compliance-overview) as a set of controls or requirements. 
You can import a compliance standard/framework or a security questionnaire,
map security procedures to a compliance requirement or control, and many
other compliance tasks.
