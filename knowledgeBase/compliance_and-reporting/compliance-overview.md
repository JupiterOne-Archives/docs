# Compliance Management in JupiterOne

JupiterOne empowers your cybersecurity and GRC teams with a centralized, compliance-as-code solution that automatically gathers evidence to support compliance needs and processes. JupiterOne gives you continuous compliance capabilities, leading to stronger security that goes beyond a single point in time.

J1 Compliance is a flexible platform for you to import and manage any compliance standard or framework as a set of controls or requirements. 

## Getting Started with J1 Compliance

The first step in managing compliance is adding the security frameworks to which your organization wants to be compliant. Frameworks comprise benchmarks, standards, and security questionnaires.

By default, J1 applies requirements to each framework to which you can then add data-driven compliance evidence and link to controls. See the [J1 data model for GRC](../jupiterOne-data-model/org-grc.md) for further context.


You can use  J1 Compliance for each step in the security compliance workflow:

- [Select security frameworks](./compliance-import.md) 
- [Add data-driven compliance evidence](./compliance-mapping-evidence.md) 
- [Link to controls](./compliance-controls.md)
- [Link policies and procedures](./compliance-mapping-policies.md)
- [Perform automated gap analysis](./compliance-gap-analysis.md)
- [Export compliance artifacts](./compliance-export.md)
- [Review compliance status and maturity](./compliance-status.md)
