# Compliance Status and Maturity

The J1 Compliance Status view provides measurements and status indicators at four different maturity levels for each compliance framework and its requirements and controls:

- Documented policies and procedures
- Implementation evidence, either via data-driven queries or external evidence
- Gap analysis between fulfilled requirements and outstanding remediation
- Continuous monitoring and remediation
