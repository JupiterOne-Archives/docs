  If you have the J1 Admin permission, you see a Share button that enables you to control access to your Insights board to specific internal users or groups. When determining the public access, you have the option of creating a public link you can share or list a range of IP addresses that you want to allow access to the dashboard, blocking any users from IP addresses outside of that range.
