# Compliance Mapping - Evidence

Each compliance requirement or control can have the following items as evidence:

- Mapped query questions
- Linked external evidence
- Additional notes

## Query Questions

From the compliance requirement details view, you can add a new question or map an existing question to the selected requirement.

As long as data is represented within JupiterOne -- entities and relationships that comes from either managed integrations or custom automation, writing queries to provide data-drive compliance evidence is the recommended approach.

Each "question" can have one or more queries. The queries can be named to trigger automated compliance gap analysis. See [this article](./compliance-gap-analysis.md) for more details.

## External Evidence

In some cases, compliance evidence cannot be provided via data available in JupiterOne. There are two ways to provide this evidence for a given control: as an external link to a document hosted outside of JupiterOne (such as on SharePoint or Google Docs), or using a direct uploaded (such as a screenshot or PDF).  

Both external evidence types require a name and have an optional description.

[Watch this video](https://try.jupiterone.com/blog/video-evidence-collection-with-the-compliance-app) to see examples of queries you can use to collect and map evidence to controls.

## Notes

Additionally, free-form notes can be added to any compliance requirement or control item to provide more details or context as needed. Each note, when saved, will capture the author and timestamp.
