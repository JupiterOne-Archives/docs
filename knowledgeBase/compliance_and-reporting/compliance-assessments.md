# Using J1 Assessments

JupiterOne provides assessments that contain compliance questions that enable you to see the power of J1 when you run this assessment. You can also create your own custom assessment by selecting any questions from the J1 question library. Each selected question creates one associated compliance requirement in the assessment. Access the assessments from the left navigation pane in J1 Compliance.

### Running a Starter Assessment

If you are a new user, you see on the J1 landing page, the option to run a starter assessment.
