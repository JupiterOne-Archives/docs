# Getting Started with Insights Dashboards

J1 Insights enables you to build reporting dashboards using J1QL queries. You can either import prebuilt Insights dashboards or create a custom one of your own.

You can configure each dashboard either as a team dashboard that you share with other account users or a personal dashboard for a single user. 

The layout of each dashboard is individually saved per user, including the layout for team boards, so that you can configure layouts according to your own preferences without impacting others. Administrators can save a team board layout as a default for other users.

Here are a few example boards and their configurations: [https://github.com/JupiterOne/insights-dashboards](https://github.com/JupiterOne/insights-dashboards).

J1 provides premade dashboards called J1 Managed Dashboards. You can duplicate/clone them so you can edit and customize the dashboards. Click the bookmark icon ![](../assets/icons/bookmark.png) to save a dashboard as a favorite. You must select which subcategory you want to save it in.

Insights dashboards consist of individual charts that you can edit and download as PNG files. The charts can be of one of the following types:

**Number**

The number chart visualization shows a one large statistical value. You are able to configure color-coded thresholds that help you tell a story of good vs. bad results. 

**Pie**

The pie chart displays values from one or more queries, as they relate to each other, in the form of slices of a pie. The arc length, area, and central angle of a slice are all proportional to the slices value, as it relates to the sum of all values. This type of chart is best used when you want a quick comparison of a small set of values in an aesthetically pleasing form.

**Line**

The line chart is created by plotting a series of several points and connecting them with a straight line. This type is best suited for data that has historical trend data enabled. 

**Bar**

The bar chart visualization allows you to view categorical data to analyze your queries with a specified x and y axis. You are able to run multiple queries and visualize the bar chart in a stacked format. This chart is best suited for categorizing your results. 

**Matrix** 

The matrix chart is used for analyzing and displaying the relationship between data sets. The matrix diagram shows the relationship between two, three, or four groups of information. 

**Table** 

The tables chart present data in as close to raw form as possible. Tables are meant to be read, so they are ideal when you have data that cannot easily be presented visually, or when the data requires more specific attention.

**Graph** 

The graph chart displays a tree graph of query results. This chart is best used to visualize specific relationships between entities. 

**Status** 

The status chart displays a visual summary of correlating queries. This chart is best used to show positive or negative results based on if relationships are present in query results. This chart is best suited for multiple queries. 

**Area** 

The area chart is a graph that combines a line chart and a bar chart to show changes in quantities over time. This is best suited for data that has historical trend data enabled. *(These can also be generated by J1 Questions that have trend collection enabled.)*

## Creating Insights Dashboards

There are three ways to create a new Insights dashboard:

- Create a customized dashboard based on your queries
- Import a J1 prebuilt dashboard template that you can edit
- Upload the schema of a previously created dashboard

### Create a Custom Insights Dashboard with Custom Charts

You can build your own custom dashboard with customized, individual charts. Each chart is powered by one or more J1QL queries.

1. Go to **J1** **Insights**.

   ## Upload a Dashboard Schema

   If there is a dashboard schema you want to use that you or someone else in your team previously created, you can upload it your Insights.

### Publishing J1 Insights Dashboards

If you have the J1 Admin role, you can publish J1 Insights dashboards to the J1 home page of a user or a group. At the top-right of the J1 Insights landing page, click the ![](../assets/icons/insights-send-to-home.png) icon. In the Show on Home dialog, select the user or group to whom you want to push the dashboard, and click **Save**. Ensure the users you select have the access settings to view the dashboard.
