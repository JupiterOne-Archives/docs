# Account and Billing-Related FAQs

## What are entities? And how are they counted for usage/billing?

An `entity` is a `node` stored in the JupiterOne graph database. Entities typically come from an integration. They can also be added via the Asset Inventory web app or API (custom scripts).

Each entity represents an object from your organization's digital operational environment. Examples include an AWS EC2 instance, RDS DB cluster, RDS DB instance, IAM role, IAM policy, user endpoint, etc.

The following entities are not counted for billing/usage calculation:

- **Mapped Entities** -- these are entities with `_source='system-mapper'` property. These are entities derived by the JupiterOne Mapper, such as an external Network or Host entity created because a security group contains a rule pointing to it.

- **System Internal Entities** -- these are entities with `_source='system-internal'` property. These are internal JupiterOne system/app generated resources that are mapped to the graph as entities, such as `compliance_standard`,  `compliance_requirement`, etc.

- **Findings and PRs** -- these entities are considered "event-like" and not true resources in an digital operating environment, therefore they are not being counted for usage/billing purpose.

- **Images, NetworkInterfaces, and IpAddress** -- these entities are also not counted against the usage or billing.

- **Records and DomainRecords** -- records such as DNS records, Jira issues are not considered as billable.

Billable entities count is averaged daily, and again monthly. This can be viewed by going to **Settings** -> **Account Management** in the JupiterOne web UI.

**Note:**

    There is a soft-limit on non-billable entitites. Depending on your JupiterOne
    subscription plan, the soft-limit is 2x, 5x or 10x of the total billable
    entities limit.
    
    For example, if your purchased the Enterprise Premier plan with 50,000 billable
    entities, you can have up to 500,000 non-billable entities.

You can also run the following query in your account to get a live count of your billable entities:

```j1ql
Find * with
  _source !^= 'system-' and
  _class != (
    'Finding' or 'PR' or 'Image' or 
    'NetworkInterface' or 'IpAddress' or 
    'Record' or 'DomainRecord'
  ) as e
return
  count(e) as billableEntityCount
```
