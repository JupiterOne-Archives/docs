# Invite Users to Your J1 Account or Organization

Adding others to your J1 account/organization is done using a simple invitation process. To send an invite:

1. Go to ![](../assets/icons/gear.png) **Settings**, select ![](../assets/icons/users.png) **Users & Access**.

2. In the user groups modal, click **Add Group** and enter a name for the new group and, optionally, a description.

3. Click ![](../assets/icons/add-user.png) **Add User** and enter the email address of the person you want to invite.

4. Click ![](../assets/icons/send.png) **Send Invitation**.

   The user receives an invitation email to join your account/organization and is prompted to accept the invite upon login. New users are then prompted to create their J1 user account.

**Note:**

    - You must be a member of the Administrators group to be able to invite other users.

    - If you are an Enterprise customer and use SAML SSO, see the instructions [here](../APIs_and-integrations/APIs/identity_and-access-management/configure-sso-integration.md).
