# JupiterOne 14 April 2022 Critical Assets Release

## April 14, 2022

## New Feature
Critical Assets is now generally available. Critical Assets enables you to quickly view and manage any risk around the most important assets in your infrastructure.

This update inlcudes the following enhancements:
- Define your Critical Assets in the Assets Inventory by [customizing your Critical Assets] (https://community.askj1.com/kb/articles/799-using-filters-in-the-asset-inventory-app).
- Use J1QL to define more complex methods of identifying your Critical Assets by using the new Alert Rule action of "Tag Entities"

- Import Rule from the Critical Assets rule pack which provides you alerts for when critical assets have been directly exposed to the internet or allowed access to everyone, for when new critical assets have been identified in the past 24 hours, or for when critical assets have been deleted in the past 24 hours.
- View problems such as compliance gaps or alerts associated with your Critical Assets on the key metrics dashboard in J1 Search

- Monitor your Critical Assets with the Critical Asset Attack Surface Insights dashboard which provides visibility to your critical assets that are indirectly connected to the internet or allowing access to everyone, inclusive of the potential attack paths that could expose these critical assets.
