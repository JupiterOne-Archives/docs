# JupiterOne July 2023 Release

## Platform Updates


## New Features and Improvements

### Unified Device Matrix is now available
- Your Device inventory just got a whole lot simpler with the new release of the J1 Unified Device Matrix. The matrix will allow you to visualize a consolidated matrix of all your devices in your inventory and be able to correlate those devices by key data-sources to answer some key questions. Here are a few examples: _which devices are missing endpoint agents?_, _which devices are not aligned to our company's directory services?_, _what OS distrubutions do we have across our entire device inventory?_, _which devices are not encrypted?_, _which devices are not managed or are without configuration management?_
- Reach out to your Customer Success Team at J1 to get access to the Unified Device Matrix
