## New Features and Improvements

### Unified Device Matrix is now available
- Your Device inventory just got a whole lot simpler with the new release of the J1 Unified Device Matrix. The matrix will allow you to visualize a consolidated matrix of all your devices in your inventory and be able to correlate those devices by key data-sources to answer some key questions. Here are a few examples: _which devices are missing endpoint agents?_, _which devices are not aligned to our company's directory services?_, _what OS distrubutions do we have across our entire device inventory?_, _which devices are not encrypted?_, _which devices are not managed or are without configuration management?_

### Integrations - Usability Enhancements
- Integration set up just got a whole lot clearer with the addition of the view into the **Data Model** and relevant **J1QL Questions** that the integration supports.

- Understanding integration job errors is a crucial step in making integrations run in a seamless manner. That's why we're thrilled to introduce Job Error Drawer - a tool designed to provide users with detailed insights into errors from integration runs to help you get to a resolution quickly and get back to your workflows.
