# JupiterOne 19 July 2022 Release

## New Features and Improvements
- Updates to the IAM policy filters: For account-level API keys, you are able to set permissions to `* all`, allowing an account token to access all actions and all resources. 

- The J1 graph engine is updated to provide faster processing. Additionally, the overall look-and-feel of the graph is enhanced. Look for continual updates to the graph over the coming months! 

- Customizing your J1 Compliance frameworks just got easier! When adding additional mapped questions to a requirement for a framework from the J1 managed questions library, you are able to have that question added automatically for each additional instance of that framework. This enhancement enables you to monitor what matters to you, and leverage JupiterOneâ€™s automatic evidence collection. You are also able to add that managed question to existing frameworks at the same time.
