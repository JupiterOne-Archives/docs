## New Features and Improvements
- Favorite Insights dashboards, allowing you to easily find the dashboards that matter to you. 
- Navigate the graph using built-in zoom funtionality, via buttons on the graph. 
- Adavanced search for Assets: When searching within Assets, you can now use two methods to complish the same outcome - `Basic` or `J1QL`. `Basic` search uses the filters to search for asset, but is now powered by J1QL. For advanced users of JupiterOne, you can find assets by writing a query.
