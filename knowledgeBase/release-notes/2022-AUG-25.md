# JupiterOne 25 August 2022 Release

## New Features and Improvements
- Favorite Insights dashboards, allowing you to easily find the dashboards that are important to you. 
- Navigate the J1 graph using the built-in zoom funtionality, using the buttons on the graph. 
- Adavanced search for J1 Assets: When searching within J1 Assets, you can now use two methods to accomplish the same outcome - `Basic` or `J1QL`. `Basic` search uses the filters to search for assets, which is now powered by J1QL. For advanced users of JupiterOne, you can find assets by writing a query.
