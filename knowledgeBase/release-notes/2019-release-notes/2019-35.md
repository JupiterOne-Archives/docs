# JupiterOne 2019.35 Release

2019-12-10

## New Features

- Exciting new capabilities added to **alert rules**, including:

  - Added **mapping and templating capability** in alert rules that allows
    detailed data from alerts to be used in alert actions.
  
    > For example, if multiple S3 buckets were part of an alert, you can add the
    bucket name and other details of each bucket to the email body or the
    description of a Jira ticket.

    See more details in the [Operation Templating](../docs/schemas/alert-rule.md#operationtemplating)
    section of the [alert rule schema](../docs/schemas/alert-rule.md).
  
  - Added **webhook** support to alert action. For example:

        ```json
        "actions": [
          {
            "targetValue": "HIGH",
            "type": "SET_PROPERTY",
            "targetProperty": "alertLevel"
          },
          {
            "headers": {
              "Authorization": "Bearer abc"
            },
            "endpoint": "https://my-site.com/my-route",
            "type": "WEBHOOK",
            "method": "POST",
            "body": {
              "one": 1,
              "two": 2
            }
          }
        ]
        ```
  
  - Simplified **JavaScript-like syntax** for rule conditions.

        _Before:_

        ```json
        "condition": [
          "AND",
          [
            "queries.query0.total",
            "!=",
            0
          ]
        ]
        ```

        _Now:_

        ```json
        "condition": "{{queries.query0.total != 0}}"
        ```

  For more information on these new capabilities and how to configure, see
  [alert rule schema](../docs/schemas/alert-rule.md).

- Added **visual indicators of alert rule actions** to the UI.

  and supports greater number of data points.

  supports applying multiple filters on `type`, `severity`, and `source account`
  of vulnerability findings.

## Integrations (and "Power Ups")

  support for required application auditing policy.

  See details [here](../guides/endpoint-compliance-agent-v4.md).

## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- When an entity is selected in query results that opens up the property panel,
  the property panel now auto expands the view height as needed.
