# JupiterOne 28 July 2022 Release

## New Features and Improvements
-  The J1 graph engine is updated, providing faster processing and updates to the look-and-feel of the graph.
-  You can now open an asset in its own page, which allows you to see information about that asset in one single location. You access this page in the entity drawer in J1 Assets. 
-  Understand your API consumption for your account: Managing your account just became easier, as J1 has added methods to monitor your account usage of our rate-limited APIs.
