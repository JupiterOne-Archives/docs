## Platform Updates
- JupiterOne now supports SCIM 2.0 (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) which is an industry-standard protocol designed to simplify user identity management tasks in a multi-domain environment. With SCIM, you can keep J1 in sync with your identity provider by managing group membership, provisioning, and de-provisioning all through the IdP.

- Users can be members of multiple permission groups in J1. By default you view data based on the aggragate view of all your permissions. Now you are now able to switch between each group and their respective views/permissions. [Read more →](knowledgeBase/getting-started_and-admin/jupiterone-access-controls.md)

### Insights 
- Your Insights widgets no longer have a query limitation of 8 queries per widget, the widgets will support over 20 queries per complex widget.
- Area charts and Question trend widgets now support color modification in the customization of a widget. 

### Queries
- When you run a J1-managed question, JupiterOne will now suggest related questions that may be interesting for you to explore.
- You can now create a question from the Questions library without needing to run the query first, which will help save you some clicks as you save specific queries as questions. 

### Alerts and Rules
- You can now automatically resolve Jira issues created by J1 Alerts. For alert rules that create Jira issues, users can auto-resolve those tickets when there are no more results.
