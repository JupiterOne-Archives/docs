## Integrations
### Jamf
  - Email addresses properties are now set to all lower case on user and device entities to ensure they are consistent with other integrations.

### Kandji
  - Refactored the integration so that the `kandji_app` entity is only created once and then referenced instead of being created once for each device that Kandji manages. This update reduces the number of Kandji entities that are created. 

### Microsoft 365
  - Added additional properties 
    | Entity _type | Property |
    | ------------- | ----------- |
    | `azure_user` | `active` |
    | `azure_user` | `accountEnabled` |
    | `azure_user` | `userType` |

  - This enhancement allows you to include these properties in your\r queries, so that you can now search or configure alerts based on whether the user is active, their account is enabled or disabled, or the type of  (regular, admin, system, etc).

### SentinelOne
  - Removed the `licensekey` property from the `sentinelone_agents` entity to prevent exposure of the license key.

### Snyk
  - `snyk_finding` now uses `originalSeverity` for `severity` to match what is displayed in the UI.
  - `snyk_finding` display name was changed to use the package name.
  - Added new entities:
    | Resources         | Entity `_type`      | Entity `_class` |
    | ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
    | Snyk Group        | `snyk_group`        | `Group`         |
    | Snyk Organization | `snyk_organization` | `Organization`  |
    | Snyk Service      | `snyk_service`      | `Service`       |
