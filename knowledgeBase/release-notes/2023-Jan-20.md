## Integrations

### General
  - Added the ability to edit the polling interval for multiple configurations at the same time. For a single integration, you can now select one or more of the existing configurations and change the polling interval for the selected configurations.
  - Released a minor UI change on the main integrations page. It is now easier to filter the list of configurations between All, Configured, and Unconfigured.  Also, whatever option you select now persists. 

### LastPass
  - Added a question that answers "Are there developers who contribute code with a weak master password?"

### Microsoft Active Directory
  - Added the ability to configure the pagination size.

### XM Cyber
  - Released a new integration for XM Cyber. This is a limited, initial release and only ingests the XM Cyber Entity asset.
  - The `xmcyber_entity` lets you query which XM Cyber assets are a chokepoint and/or critical asset.

    | Resources | Entity `_type`   | Entity `_class` |
    | --------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
    | Entity    | `xmcyber_entity` | `Record`        |
