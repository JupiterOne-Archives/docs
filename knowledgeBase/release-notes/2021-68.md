## Integrations

### AWS

- Added support for S3 Event Notifciations:

  - Added `notificationEnabled` boolean property to `aws_s3_bucket`
  - Added `aws_s3_event_notification` relationships:
  
    - `aws_s3_bucket` **NOTIFIES** `aws_lambda_fuction` 
    - `aws_s3_bucket` **NOTIFIES** `aws_sqs_queue` 
    - `aws_s3_bucket` **NOTIFIES** `aws_sns_topic` 

### Azure

- Added support for ingesting the following **new** resources:

  - Entities
  
    - `azure_monitor_activity_log_alert`
    - `azure_postgresql_server_firewall_rule`
    - `azure_security_center_subscription_pricing`
    - `azure_sql_server_active_directory_admin`
    - `azure_vm_extension`
    
  - Relationships
  
    - `azure_subscription_contains_role_definition`
    - `azure_monitor_activity_log_alert_monitors_scope`
    - `azure_vm|USES|azure_storage_account`

- Added additional properties to `secureTransport`:

    - `azure_sql_server`
    - `azure_mariadb_server`
    - `azure_mysql_server`
    - `azure_postgresql_server`
    
- Added additional properties to `azure_sql_server`:
  
    - `encryptionProtector.serverKeyName`
    - `encryptionProtector.serverKeyType`
    
- Added additional properties to `azure_postgresql_server`:
  
    - `configuration.logCheckpoints`
    - `configuration.logConnections`
    - `configuration.logDisconnections`
    - `configuration.logRetentionDays`
    - `configuration.connectionThrottling`

- Added log categories to `azure_diagnostic_settings` for these entities:

  - `azure_subscription`
  
    - `log.Administrative`
    - `log.Alert`
    - `log.Policy`
    - `log.Security`
    
  - `azure_keyvault_service`
  
    - `log.AuditEvent`

- Changed `azure_advisor_recommendation.name` to use `shortDescription.solution`
  instead of `name` because `name` returned from the Azure API is a UUID.

- Changed the way that Diagnostic Settings are ingested. Previously, each `log`
  and `metric` enumerated within a Diagnostic Settings Resource was created as
  its own entity. This change creates a single `azure_diagnostic_setting`
  entity, which contains all `log`s and `metric`s in raw data. Special `log`s
  and `metric`s can be exposed as properties on the `azure_diagnostic_setting`
  entity.

### Bitbucket

- Moved from deprecated teams APIs to workspaces APIs. This was necessary to
  support new BB accounts that do not have the ability to enable teams APIs in
  OAuth Consumers. The ingested data has been changed:

  | Old type                    | New type                         |
  | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | bitbucket_team              | bitbucket_workspace              |
  | bitbucket_team_has_user     | bitbucket_workspace_has_user     |
  | bitbucket_team_owns_repo    | bitbucket_workspace_owns_repo    |
  | bitbucket_team_owns_project | bitbucket_workspace_owns_project |

  Please note that this is implemented as the creation of the new
  `bitbucket_workspace` entity and relationships and the deletion of the old
  `bitbucket_team` entity and relationships. Queries that depended on those type
  values must be updated.

### Google Cloud

- Added support for ingesting the following **new** resources

  | Service  | Resource / Entity               | 
  | --       | --                              | 
  | Redis    | `google_redis_instance`         | 
  | Memcache | `google_memcache_instance`      | 
  |          | `google_memcache_instance_node` | 

### Google Workspaces

- Support for ingesting the following **new** resources

  - Groups
  
    - `google_group_settings`
    - `google_group` **HAS** `google_group_settings`

  A Google Workspace administrator must authorize domain wide delegation to the
  JupiterOne Service Account for the scope
  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.groups.settings`. Please see the updated
  [integration setup guide](../docs/integrations/google/index.md) for details.

### Qualys

- The value of the Qualys `HostAsset.fqdn` is now normalized with
  `toLowerCase()`. The value is stored in `Finding.targets` and as `Host.fqdn`.
  This supports mapping rules that work by finding matching values.
