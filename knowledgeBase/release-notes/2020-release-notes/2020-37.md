# JupiterOne 2020.37 Release

2020-01-13

This past sprint, we focused a lot on technical improvements around platform
stability, integration data integrity, and error handling/reporting. These
improvements are not individually listed below.

## New Features

- In the **Compliance** app, separated compliance standards and security
  questionnaires in two sections in the menu side drawer and added support for
  drag-n-drop re-ordering.

- [beta/experimental] **J1QL auto-complete** as you type in the query in the
  search box in the Landing page.
  
  > Auto-complete works with data in your account. Currently it supports
  entities (both type and class) and properties, in addition to query language
  syntax/keywords. Support for relationship verb auto-complete is coming soon.

## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- UI improvements to Insights pie charts.

- Improved backend sorting in Vuln & Findings view.

- Fixed a few other things that broke.

## Community Projects

- Added example code for integration with **Vuls.io** to ingest scan findings.
