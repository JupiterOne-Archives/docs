# JupiterOne 2020.61 Release

2020-12-29

## New Features

- Refactored Policies app has been rolled out to all accounts, with a major
  release of the `policy-builder` CLI to version `4.0.0` -- the CLI has been
  updated to leverage the new and optimized APIs, which avoids hitting the `409`
  rate limit errors when publishing policies to JupiterOne and makes it at
  least 2x faster.

- In Compliance app, CIS AWS/Azure/GCP benchmarks are now organized in a
  separate section in the compliance standards panel for easier navigation.

- Compliance review feature is now generally available for all accounts.

- Multiple improvements to the visual query builder, including:

  - Relationships default to the applicable verbs upon creation
  - Added warning when more than two `RELATES TO` generic relationships are used
    in the query (for query performance optimization)
  - Only allowing full text search node to be at the beginning of the query
  - Added alias as a chip on node groups in the visual canvas
  - Corrected position of relationship labels
  - Removed arrows from relationships (relationship queries are bi-directional)
  - Added step-by-step instructions to the general panel to clarify how to get
    started with the VQB

## Integrations

### Integration SDK

- Added continuous uploads of entities/relationships during integration execution to reduce overall job execution time
- Improved performance of accessing entities/relationships from local job state
- Added support for omitting specific graph objects from file storage when they won't be needed in later steps
- Reduced disk usage/data transfer by stripping whitespace from graph objects (except in local development)

### AWS

- Change type of Elasicache snapshot entities from `aws_db_snapshot` to `aws_elasticache_snapshot`

### Azure

- Added `azure_diagnostic_log_setting` entities
- Added `azure_resource|has|azure_diagnostic_log_setting` relationships
- Added `azure_diagnostic_log_setting|uses|azure_storage_account` relationships
- Added `azure_diagnostic_metric_setting` entities
- Added `azure_resource|has|azure_diagnostic_metric_setting` relationships
- Added `azure_diagnostic_metric_setting|uses|azure_storage_account` relationships

### Google Cloud

- Adopted latest SDK to obtain performance improvements that reduce total
  execution time by continuously uploading entities/relationships to JupiterOne
  as they're collected from Google APIs

### Qualys

- Added `yarn start:qualys` to provide a mock implementation of Qualys APIs used
  by the integration to support load testing
- Adopted latest SDK to obtain performance improvements that reduce total
  execution time by continuously uploading entities/relationships to JupiterOne
  as they're collected from Qualys APIs, thereby allowing for collecting
  millions of host detections in substantially less time

### Rapid7

- Initial release of **Rapid7** integration (beta)! ðŸŽ‰
