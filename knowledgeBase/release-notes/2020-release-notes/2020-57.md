- Added a visual indicator -- `public` chip -- to Insights dashboards that have been shared via a link.

- New **compliance review workflow** feature is released in beta! This feature works as such:

  * It allows an admin to go into the Compliance and assign certain J1 users as “owners” over a compliance requirement. 
  * They can then select a frequency at which owners are required to review the evidence and compliance status for the assigned requirements. 
  * Assigned owners will get notified by email when reviews are due.

  > Contact us if you would like to participate in the beta program.

- Added support for **per record action** in alert rules (beta).
