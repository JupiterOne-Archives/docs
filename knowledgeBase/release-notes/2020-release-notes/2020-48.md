# JupiterOne 2020.48 Release

2020-06-30

## New Features

- Added **compliance status view settings** for each compliance standard object
  to toggle on/off policies, evidence, and gap analysis indicators.

  > This can be helpful when generating a PDF report to include/exclude certain
  > status indications.

- Support **On-demand Re-evaluation** of a specific compliance requirement or
  control. 
  
  > To trigger re-evaluation, click on the three-dots menu icon next to the
  > requirement/control reference ID near the top left corner.

- Users can set the **Default App** by going to **Settings (Gear Icon)** 
  and selecting **My Profile**.  The Default App is the app that will be
  launched upon login.

  > The ability for Administrators to select a Default App for a user
  > group is coming soon.

- Added dynamic display of **Pro Tips** for queries that can be improved.
  Look for the **lightbulb** icon in the query/search bar.

  been manually modified via UI/API (i.e. different value from integration
  provider).
