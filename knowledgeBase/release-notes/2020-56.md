  ![insights-dashboard-share-link](../assets/insights-dashboard-share-link.png)

  > This is similar to sharing a Google Doc file via a link. This is useful for sharing with other users 
  > in the organization who do not have a JupiterOne user account, or sharing with an external user such
  > as an auditor. 
  > 
  > Anyone with acccess to the link can view the dashboard. Please share with care. Shareable link does
  > not expire, but you can revoke the link / stop sharing at any time.

  enabled while the query is still running.

  that are outside of their integrated assets (i.e. vendor hosted) and any truely "orphaned" records.

  See details in the GitHub repo: <https://github.com/JupiterOne/nslookup-shodan>
