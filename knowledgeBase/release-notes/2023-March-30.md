# JupiterOne 31 March 2023 Release

## New Features and Improvements
-   Your `csv` exports can now support multiple queries from Insights.
-   Alerts with multiple queries in the Rules now display all queries that power the Alert, along with additional information about when an action was triggered and the results.

-   For organizations using Google as their Identity Provider, JupiterOne now pulls in the users Google profile picture into their J1 user account. 

- You can now assign users of J1 to be notified for certain Alert Rules, including yourself or others. This assigns ownership and allows you to set up Alert Rules that notify a single user (or the users assigned) when triggered, rather than everyone. 

-   Your AWS integrations now display parent-child relationships, allowing you to see the high-level view of how instances relate to each other.
