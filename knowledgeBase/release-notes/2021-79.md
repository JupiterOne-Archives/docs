# JupiterOne 2021.79 Release

September 9, 2021

## New Features and Improvements

- Introduced a new filter to define **critical assets** in the Assets app, 
  and a **smart class** query shorthand.

  Critical assets are defined using a preset combination of entities classes 
  and attributes (such as hosts and applications tagged as production). You 
  can easily customize this configuration to match your specific definition 
  of what critical assets mean for your organization.
  
  You can reference critical assets in a query using a specific smart class 
  shorthand: `#CriticalAsset`. This feature allows you to easily query and 
  monitor important changes and receive alerts when a drift or problem 
  occurs for any of the critical assets that are important to you. It allows 
  you to focus and prioritize on the most important risks.
  
  For example, to identify and alert on new critical assets added in the last 24 hours:
  
   `Find #CriticalAsset with _createdOn > date.now - 24hours`
  
  This is the initial release of this capability. We will be adding some pre-built alert 
  rules and Insights dashboards for critical assets soon.
  
  Learn more about how to customize and configure your critical assets [here](../guides/asset-inventory-filters.md#quick-filter-the-critical-assets).

- Updated the query language to follow De Morgan's Law.

  To maintain language correctness, J1QL fulfills shorthand filters in accordance 
  with De Morgan's Law. This improvement only impacts queries that use the 
  operators `!=`, `!~=`, `!^=`, `!$=` when operating on a group of values.

  For example, 

  ```j1ql
  FIND jira_user WITH accountType != ('atlassian' OR 'app' OR 'customer')
  ```

  is the equivalent of:

  ```j1ql
  FIND jira_user WITH 
    accountType != 'atlassian' AND 
    accountType !=  'app' AND 
    accountType !=  'customer'
  ```

  Basically, J1QL interprets the above query to return all `jira_user` entities, 
  excluding those that have an `accountType` value of `atlassian` or `app` or `customer`. 

  !!! warning
      **This is a breaking change!** We have taken precautions to ensure saved questions 
      and queries are not inadvertently affected.  

      We have run maintenance jobs to update all saved queries in questions, 
      alerts, and Insights dashboard widgets.
      You do NOT have to make any changes manually in JupiterOne.
      
      However, if you have stored queries outside of your JupiterOne account 
      (such as in a custom script), please update those queries accordingly.   

  

- Updated the JupiterOne query language to [enable relationship direction](../docs/jupiterOne-query-language_(J1QL).md) with the use 
  of double arrows,`<<` and `>>`. 
  Relationship direction can be important, depending on your requirements, giving J1QL 
  more specificity on exactly how entities should relate to each other. For example, 
  if you were to use the following query:
  
  ```
  FIND aws_iam_role as trusting THAT TRUSTS aws_iam_role as trusted 
  return trusting.name, trusted.name
  ```
  
  The above query does not specify direction, so aliasing one as trusted and the other 
  trusting does not behave as expected. Both entities will be represented in either 
  column. By using double arrows, you can indicate the relationship direction:
  
  ```
  FIND UNIQUE aws_iam_role as trusting THAT TRUSTS >> aws_iam_role as trusted 
  return trusting.name, trusted.name`
  ```
  
- Added traversal filters for use with the `where` clause to support filtering via `AND` and 
  `OR` operators upon a single field, for example: `find User where User.id=(1 or 2 or 3)`. 

- Added search functionality to the Groups page in the Users & Access menu.

- Improved the text wrapping in the query search window.

- Query Anywhere now auto-focuses when opened so you can immediately start typing.

- Improved error messaging in the UI when bulk synchronization fails.

## Dashboards

Added new reporting/visualization widgets to the S3 Security Insights dashboard:

- Buckets granted access to AWS services without source condition
- Public buckets with sensitive data or secrets
- S3 cross account access via VPC peering
- SAML SSO users with access to production s3 buckets
- S3 buckets with server access logging enabled
- S3 buckets with object level logging enabled
- Production S3 buckets without any logging enabled
- S3 buckets publishing inventory reports

Reimport the dashboard from the Insights app to get these new widgets in your account.

Stay tuned as additional dashboards, alert rules, managed questions, and compliance frameworks, and mappings are updated.

## Bug Fixes

- Resolved an issue where the Policy app would not load under certain conditions.

- Resolved an error where users could not accept an invite if they were logged into 
  another account with SSO.

- Resolved an auto-complete issue in Query Anywhere.

- Resolved the double scroll bars issue on the landing page.


## Integrations

### AWS

- Ingested EC2 settings: `ebsDefaultKmsKeyId` and `ebsEncryptionByDefault`.

- Created mapped relationships between the `aws_ec2` service entity and the default
  `aws_kms_key` entity.

  !!! note 
      This change requires the additional `ec2:GetEbsDefaultKmsKeyId` and
      `ec2:GetEbsEncryptionByDefault` permissions in the
      `JupiterOneSecurityAudit` IAM policy of each AWS account being monitored.

- Added `ebsOptimizedByDefault` and `ebsOptimizationSupported` Boolean flags on
  EC2 instance assets. See [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html).
  
- Ingested AutoScaling policies and built `aws_autoscaling_group` `USES`
  `aws_autoscaling_policy` relationships.

- Mapped relationships from `aws_sns_topic` and `aws_sns_subscription` to the
  endpoint asset on each subscription (such as an HTTP endpoint, a person by
  email, or a Lambda function).

- Ingested roots and OUs in an AWS organization and mapped sub-accounts to each
  root/OU.

- Added ELB attributes to properties. The attributes are mapped to properties as
  follows:

  | ELB Entity Property     | ELB Attribute                                              |
  | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `deletionProtection`    | `deletion_protection.enabled`                              |
  | `loggingEnabled`        | `access_logs.s3.enabled`                                   |
  | `loggingTargetBucket`   | `access_logs.s3.bucket`                                    |
  | `loggingTargetPrefix`   | `access_logs.s3.prefix`                                    |
  | `idleTimeoutSeconds`    | `idle_timeout.timeout_seconds`                             |
  | `desyncMitigationMode`  | `routing.http.desync_mitigation_mode`                      |
  | `dropInvalidHeaders`    | `routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled`          |
  | `http2`                 | `routing.http2.enabled`                                    |
  | `tlsVersionEnabled`     | `routing.http.x_amzn_tls_version_and_cipher_suite.enabled` |
  | `tlsCipherSuiteEnabled` | `routing.http.x_amzn_tls_version_and_cipher_suite.enabled` |
  | `xffClientPortEnabled`  | `routing.http.xff_client_port.enabled`                     |
  | `wafFailOpen`           | `waf.fail_open.enabled`                                    |
  | `crossZone`             | `load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled`                        |

- Fixed a false positive where some buckets were incorrectly identified as 
  public (with permission relationships to `everyone`) when the policy condition 
  contains specific OrgIds or AccountIds.

- Added the `aws_organization` asset.

- Added support for parsing `aws:PrincipalOrgID` IAM policy conditions and mapped
  relationships to the corresponding `aws_organization` asset.

- Improved IAM resource policy condition parsing to map permissions to services
  instead of the account when certain services are specified in the action.

### Azure

- Fixed the authorization token expiration to support steps that execute for more than one hour.

### Google Cloud

- Improved accuracy of the CIS 4.3 managed question, "Is blocking of project-wide SSK keys enabled for my Google Cloud VM instances?"

- Relationships from `google_cloud_organization`s and `google_cloud_folder`s to
  `google_cloud_project`s are now created for deleted projects.

- Modified the `google_bigquery_dataset` step to be independent from
  `google_kms_crypto_key` step to ensure BigQuery data is ingested even 
  when KMS Keys ingestion is disabled or fails.
  
- Added the following new properties to these resources:

  | Asset                   | Properties              |
  | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
  | `google_storage_bucket` | `isSubjectToObjectAcls` |
  | `google_iam_binding`    | `readonly`              |

- Updated `google_storage_bucket.public` to be `true` when the storage
  bucket does not have Uniform Bucket Access Level enabled. We cannot determine
  if the bucket is public or not when this setting is disabled.

### OneLogin

- Application Rules are now `Configuration` assets in the graph.

- Onelogin `User`s are related to the AWS IAM roles they have access to based on the presence of IAM role ARNs in the application rules. 
  This change requires that the IAM Role asset already exists in the J1 graph (the AWS integration is installed).

- Added raw data to assets.
