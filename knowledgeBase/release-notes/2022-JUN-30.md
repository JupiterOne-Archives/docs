# JupiterOne 30 June 2022 Release

## New Features and Improvements
-  Introducing: Assessments! Assessments provide an easy way to understand what's in your environment, based on J1QL queries.Based on question categories, Assessments add all questions under a category (such as Incident Response) and automatically runs them, giving you a greater understand of what's in your environment and what needs attention. Assessments are available to those with Compliance access.
-  Scope Filters in Compliance now support tag values, giving you the ability to scope a framework or benchmark to a specific tag easily. 
-  Additional filtering options are now available in the Add Question modal when adding evidence to a framework requirement. You are able to filter based on question categories and tags, as well as show managed questions and the details of the query (for a question). 
-  Organizational values for Policies are now synced to account parameters, giving you the ability to use secret values in Polciies. Alternatively, this allows you to reference platform-wide variables, versus those scoped specifically to Policies.
