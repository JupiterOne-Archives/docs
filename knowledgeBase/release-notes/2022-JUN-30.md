# JupiterOne 30 June 2022 Release

## New Features and Improvements
-  Introducing: Assessments! Assessments provide an easy way to understand what is in your environment, based on J1QL queries. Assessments groups all questions in a category (such as Incident Response) and automatically runs them, giving you a greater understand of what needs your attention in your environment. Assessments are available to everyone with J1 Compliance access.
-  Scope filters in J1 Compliance now support tag values, giving you the ability to easily scope a framework or benchmark to a specific tag. 
-  Additional filtering options are now available in the J1 Compliance Add Question modal when adding evidence to a framework requirement. You are able to filter based on question categories and tags, as well as show managed questions and the details of the query for a question. 
-  Organizational values for J1 Policies are now synced to account parameters, enabling you to use secret values in J1 Policies. Alternatively, this feature allows you to reference platform-wide variables, versus those scoped specifically to J1 Policies. 

## Integrations



## Bug Fixes
- Fixed multiple bugs related to Search and Search history performance. 
- Resolved an issue with limits on custom questions in Search.
- Addressed a problem with the Compliance control library where updates were not reflected without a refresh.

## Coming Soon
- In the coming weeks, we will be introducing a new navigation pattern. We are retiring the tile pattern for navigating between areas of the platform, and pulling out each application into the top-level navigation bar. 
- The Asset details drawer is getting some updates! Stay tuned for more information.
