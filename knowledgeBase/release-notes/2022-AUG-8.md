# JupiterOne 28 July 2022 Release

## New Features and Improvements
- Insights has a new navigation structure! The new structure is static, which makes finding Team and Personal boards easier, and carries over JupiterOne's look and feel. 
- We've also updated the layout of Insight dashboards to improve widget layouts. These changes are mostly visual and focus on the sizing, fonts, and font weights. 
- New Integration notifications: For each new integration you configured, you are now notified when the first job for that integration completes, alerting you to the status of integrations within your environment. This action occurs for the first time the integration is set up, and for new integration instances (e.g. additional AWS instances).
