# JupiterOne 2018.12 Release

2018-10-15

## New Features

- **Search and Query** with the JupiterOne Query Language (J1QL) - J1QL seamlessly blends full-text search and querying of the entity-relationship graph. It is simple to construct which aspires to be as close to natural language as possible. It is available directly on the home page / Landing Zone app.

- **Automatic mapping of AWS IAM users to Person/employee entities** if the IAM username is the same as the email address belonging to the Person/employee.

## Improvements

- Stability improvements of the graph database backend
- Bug fixes for indexing and full-text search services
