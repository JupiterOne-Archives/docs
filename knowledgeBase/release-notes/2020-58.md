# JupiterOne 2020.58 Release

2020-11-17

## New Features

- Modified API to pass account ID via `JupiterOne-Account` header (it is backwards compatible with
  the legacy `LifeOmic-Account` header).

- Added support to generate integrations API key that can be used to run integrations in your own infrastructure.
  
  > These API keys are configured in an integration instance and scoped to that particular integration instance by
  > ID. They can only be used to synchronize data in the selected integration's scope and cannot be used to read 
  > the graph or perform any other action in the system.

**Sneak peek:** 
_We are working on a visual query builder to make it easier to construct J1QL queries. Stay tuned!_
