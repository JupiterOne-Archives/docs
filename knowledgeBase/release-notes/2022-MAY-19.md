## May 19, 2022



## New Features and Improvements
- File formats in `.csv` are now supported for entities and relationships. This allows for the creation of new assets without needing a `.json` or `.yaml` file.
- The following properties for an entity are now displayed as metadata within the entity drawer: `_integrationClass` ,` _scope` , `and _integrationType`. Use these metadata properties to search and find similar entity types.

## Integrations





## Bug Fixes
- Resolved an issue with the entity drawer wasn't rendering correctly in search results. 
- Fixed a bug where attempting to open a compliance requirement in a new tab simply redirected back to the main compliance status page. 
- Addressed a problem where the KPI widget for new problems discovered did not sort the problems correctly, basead on the numeric level of criticality.
