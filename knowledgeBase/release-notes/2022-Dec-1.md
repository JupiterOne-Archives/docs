## Integrations
### General
  - On the Instance Configuration page for each integration, when the polling interval is set to daily, you can now select an optional hour of the day. The integration runs at the specified hour.  For example, if the hour is set to 8:00, the integration runs between 8:00 and 9:00.
  - On the Instance Configuration page for each integration, when the polling interval is set to weekly, you can now select an optional day of the week and hour of the day. The integration then runs on a specific day or on a specific day at a specific time.
  - Fixed an issue the where CMD+delete did not clear the search value on the integrations page.
  - Improved the load times on the page that lists all of the configurations for a specific integration.  Instead of calculating the number of entities when the page is loaded, you can request the number of entities to be calculated, as needed.  There is also a link that executes a J1QL to display more details about the count for each entity that the integration is ingesting.

### AWS
  - Redshift Serverless ingestion is now supported.

### Jenkins
  - Released a new integration for [Jenkins][https://github.com/JupiterOne/graph-jenkins/blob/main/docs/jupiterone.md].
  - The following entities are created:

    | Resources  | Entity `_type`       | Entity `_class` |
    | ---------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
    | Account    | `jenkins_account`    | `Account`       |
    | Job        | `jenkins_job`        | `Project`       |
    | Repository | `jenkins_repository` | `Repository`    |
    | User       | `jenkins_user`       | `User`          |

  - The following relationships are created:

    | Source Entity `_type` | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type` |
    | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
    | `jenkins_account`     | **HAS**               | `jenkins_job`         |
    | `jenkins_account`     | **HAS**               | `jenkins_user`        |
    | `jenkins_job`         | **HAS**               | `jenkins_job`         |
    | `jenkins_job`         | **HAS**               | `jenkins_repository`  |
