## Integrations
- We have added an integration with Workday, leveraging Merge. [Read more about our Workday integration](https://docs.jupiterone.io/integrations/directory/workday).
- We have updated our Azure integration to allow the ingestion of 'Disabled' subscriptions in addition to the other subscription sates supported: ‘Enabled’, ‘PastDue’, ’Warned’ and ’Expired’. You can enable the importation of 'Disabled' subscription by activating the **Import Disabled Subscriptions** toggle within your Azure integration instance. Note that your Azure integration instance must already have the **Configure Subscription Instances** toggle enabled for you to ingest disabled subscriptions.
