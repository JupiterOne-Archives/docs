# JupiterOne June 2023 Release

## Platform Updates
- Effective Friday, July 14th, query results will be delivered via a jupiterone.io URL.  The new domains used for data retrieval will be `download.us.jupiterone.io` and `download.eu.jupiterone.io`.  Please ensure these new domains are added to your allow list as a result of this update.

## New Features and Improvements

### Queries
- J1 now offers the field [j1_severity](knowledgeBase/jupiterOne-data-model/jupiterone-data-model.md) on Findings which presents a normalized severity for most Integrated tools that provide findings to JupiterOne. For example, you can now the following queries to return findings across multiple sources of findings data: 
  - `find Finding with j1_severity = "high"`: This returns a list of all findings with a normalized severity of “high”.
  - `find Finding with j1_severity != undefined as f RETURN f.[j1_severity], count (f)`: This returns a count of all findings in j1 grouped by j1_severity.

    *Note: The following `_types` do not currently support the `j1_severity` field. Please let us know if you would benefit from any of these being included:*

- Your J1 Questions can now be configured to collect trend data on different polling intervals. If your query produces results that change throughout the day, you can now track trends on intervals of 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 day.

- We have updated permissions to J1Questions so that users with “Read” access to “Shared: Questions” can view questions and share questions but cannot edit, delete, or duplicate the question. Users with “Write” access to “Shared: Questions” can view questions, share questions, edit questions, delete questions, and duplicate the question.

- We now support querying for additional compliance entities including the following:
  - `compliance_requirement`
  - `reviewer Person ID`
  - `reviewNow`
  - `reviewFrequency`
  - `Owner`
  
- We have updated our `Access Permissions` entity views for `aws_iam_role`, `aws_iam_group`, and `aws_iam_user` to be a matrix visualization to help you gather more information at a glance of the types of access to AWS resources these identity types have.

- We have made usability/accessibility enhancements in the J1 `data-table` to allow for you to use keyboard shortcut keys like `command+c` or `CTRL+C` to copy values more easily from the `data-table`.



 ### Alerts and Rules
  
- We have made it easier to view and update the Rules that power your alerts within the Alerts UI by surfacing Rules to sit alongside Alerts in the view's primary actions.

### Policies and Compliance

- In J1 Policies, we now support downloading to HTML in addition to downloading to PDF.

You can enable the importation of 'Disabled' subscription by activating the **Import Disabled Subscriptions** toggle within your Azure integration instance. Note that your Azure integration instance must already have the **Configure Subscription Instances** toggle enabled for you to ingest disabled subscriptions.

- **Polymer**: Added mapped relationships from Polymer findings to Google Workspace, Slack, and GitHub to indicate ownership of findings and other additional context. **Note**: This integration is currently in beta.
- **SalesForce**: Added the ability to filter ingested users by user **Role** and **Profile** to avoid rate limits and improve performance.
- **ServiceNow**: Added the capability to ingest a customizable level of **ServiceNow CMDB** data. Includes relationships showing *to whom assets are assigned* and *who owns/manages the assets*.
- **Tanium**: Added ingestion of Software Inventory data from "Tanium Asset" add-on capability.

### Bug Fixes
