## Platform Updates
- Effective Friday July 14th, query results will be delivered via a jupiterone.io URL.  The new domains used for data retrieval will be download.us.jupiterone.io and download.eu.jupiterone.io.  Please ensure these new domains are added to your allow list as a result of this update

## New Features and Improvements
- J1 now offers the field [j1_severity](knowledgeBase/jupiterOne-data-model/jupiterone-data-model.md) on Findings which presents a normalized severity for most* Integrated tools that provide findings to jupiterone. For example, you can now the following queries to return findings across multiple sources of findings data: 
 --  `find Finding with [j1_severity] = "high"` This returns a list of all findings with a normalized severity of “high”
 -- `find Finding with [j1_severity] != undefined as f RETURN f.[j1_severity], count (f)` This returns a count of all findings in j1 grouped by j1_severity

- We have made it easier to view and update the Rules that power your alerts within the Alerts UI by surfacing Rules to sit alongside Alerts in the views primary actions.

- Your J1 Questions can now be configured to collect trend data on different polling intervals. If your query produces results that change throughout the day, you can now track trends on intervals of 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 day.

- We have updated permissions to J1Questions so that users with “Read” access to “Shared: Questions” can view questions and share questions, but cannot edit, delete, or duplicate the question. Users with “Write” access to “Shared: Questions” can view questions, share questions, edit questions, delete questions, and duplicate the question. 
  
- We have updated our `Access Permissions` entity views for `aws_iam_role`, `aws_iam_group`, and `aws_iam_user` to be a matrix visualization to help you gather more information at a glance of the types of access to AWS resources these identity types have.

- We have made usability/accessibility enhancements in the J1 `data-table` to allow for you to use keyboard shortcut keys like `command+c` or `CTRL+C` to copy values more easily from the `data-table`.

- In J1 Policies, we now support download to HTML in addition to download to PDF.
