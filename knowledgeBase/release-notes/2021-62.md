# JupiterOne 2021.62 Release

2021-01-13

_Our first sprint in 2021!_

## New Features

- New **optional relationship traversal** feature added to J1QL! 

  Here's an example showing the syntax with the optional relationship wrapped in
  `()?`:

  ```j1ql
  Find User (that assigned AccessRole)?
    that assigned AccessPolicy
    that allows as permission *
  where permission.admin=true
  return TREE
  ```

  The example above searches for Users that are directly assigned an
  AccessPolicy granting admin permissions to certain resources, or via an
  AccessRole assigned to the User.

  > Note that this is a beta feature and the syntax for describing optional
  > traversals may change in the future to help improve clarity. 
  > 
  > For full documentation, please see the **Optional traversals** section in the
  > [JupiterOne Query Language doc](../docs/jupiterOne-query-language_(J1QL).md).

- Another significant query performance improvement for all types of queries
  (including aggregate queries, queries with negations, and optional
  traversals).

- Added _Cursor_ support for J1QL queries via the API. 

  See details in the **Querying the graph with J1QL** section of the 
  [Platform API Doc](../docs/jupiterone-api.md).

- **Visual Query Builder** now supports

  * **Aggregate** returns (i.e. `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG` functions)
  * **Grouping** returns by an attribute value
  * Allowing filter values to be selected as `undefined`

- Added the ability to **assign compliance review owners at the standard level**.

  Also in Compliance Review editing, the user assignment dropdown shown in the
  modal now shows names, avatars, and emails to more easily identify user
  accounts.

- Added `resultsAre` field to J1QL questions. This field will be used for
  questions mapped to compliance requirements to perform gap analysis, instead
  of using the `name` of each query as the key. This allows each query in a
  question to have a more descriptive name.

  _Here's a screenshot of the edit question modal:_

  _See tabs with names in the screenshot below:_

  > Note: this change is backwards compatible to any existing question with queries
  > named `good`, `bad`, or `unknown`. These questions/queries will continue to
  > work for compliance gap analysis. Pre-packaged questions have been updated with
  > `resultsAre` field and more descriptive query names.
  > 
  > See [this doc](../guides/compliance/compliance-gap-analysis.md) for details
  > on how the compliance gap analysis is calculated.

- Added quick toggles for boolean properties in the entity property panel.
