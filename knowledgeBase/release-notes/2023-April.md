# JupiterOne April 2023 Release

## New Features and Improvements

-  Alert on only new outcomes for Rules: you can now elect to receive an alert when your Rule produces a new outcome that has not been seen before. This means you will be able to more efficiently monitor what matters and stay up-to-date with any new developments.
- You can now download your policies in HTML format, in addition to other existing foramts supported by J1.
- When writing queries with Query Builder, only data with relationships to the root class/entity are shown. This shows you directly the classes and entities available to you and reduces the noise of what's in your environment to only show you the possible. 
- You can now preview an Insights widget before publishing, allowing you to see how your query is represented in real-time so that you can make adjustments before publishing. 
- Uploading integrations via `csv` just got easier with a new `csv` upload process. 
- J1 Settings has a new look-and-feel that makes managing your profile, API keys, and user management easier. A few key highlights include:
   - The ability to change your profile picture. 
   - Improved search capabilities for managing users and groups
   - Robust user management, including a full view of a user and thier persmissions, along with the groups they belong to.
- Integrations that are currently in an `early access` phase are now visible within `Integrations` in the Platform. This gives you visability into what new integrations are coming, as well as an oppertunity to opt-in for early access use.
