# JupiterOne 6 April 2022 Release

## April 6, 2022

## New Features and Improvements

- J1 Alerts now allows you to tag assets within a new or existing alerts, including tagging an alert as a `critical asset`.
- If an icon has been added for a vendor within your environment, it now displays in status charts (such as Insights, vendors, and risks in J1Compliance) in various areas of the JupiterOne platform. 
- J1 Compliance now offers a gaps table for quick, actionable insights into the compliance gaps identified across your environment. The consolidated view of gaps makes working through associated tasks and the impacted assets straightforward, without having to get into other areas of J1 Compliance. 
- When query questions are deleted, they are now automatically unmapped from J1 Compliance requirements and controls. 
- The new compliance APIs are officially integrated into the main JupiterOne API endpoint. These APIs expose a graph of your compliance data, including frameworks, evidence, controls, and more. You can perform GraphQL introspection on the JupiterOne API to see all the new available operations.
- The `includeDeleted` property is now supported in alert rule queries. When the `includeDeleted` value is true, the specific query allows for deleted data to be considered.

## Integrations




## Bug Fixes

- Resolved some issues regarding how deleted questions were managed.
