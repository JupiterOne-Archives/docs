# JupiterOne 6 October 2022 Release

## New Features and Improvements
-   J1 Insights can now pass a variable directly to a shared dashboard URL. 
-   The Insights navigation has a new modern style to help you get to your boards easier. 
-   Scrolling in Insights is now easier with enhancements to J1 Graph and pie charts. 
-   A class filter is now available in J1 Graph to help you specify your query results in the Graph. 
-   Shortcut keys are now available in the Graph to enhance the undo and redo experience while exploring your query results. 
-   You can now set a default in the Graph Insights widget to group or expand nodes upon loading. 

## Integrations
### General
  - It is now possible to add custom tags to an integration configuration directly from the UI.

### Azure
  - Fixed an issue that could occur during the fetch-batch-application step.
  - Fixed an issue with the relationship being created between `azure_kubernetes_service` and `azure_resource_group`.

### Cisco Secure Workload
  - Added new entities:

    | Entity       | Resource   |
    | ------------ | ---------- |
    | `csw_policy` | `Policy`   |

  - Added new relationships:

    | Source Entity `_type` | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type` |
    | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
    | `csw_account`         | **HAS**               | `csw_policy`          |
    | `csw_policy`          | **HAS**               | `csw_scope`           |

### GitHub
  - Added a relationship between two pull requests that share the same merge commit. This feature allows for the discovery of pull-request merges without approval given the following scenario:

    > PR1 - Branch A -> main with commit {A}  
    > PR2 - Branch B -> main with commits {A, B}  
    > PR3 - Branch C -> main with commits {A, B, C}

  	If PR3 is merged first, PR1 and PR2 are flagged as MERGED and potentially without approval in some circumstances. This new CONTAINS relationship indicates that PR3 ->CONTAINS-> (PR1 | PR2).

        | Source Entity `_type` | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type` |
        | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
        | `github_pullrequest`  | **CONTAINS**          | `github_pullrequest`  |

  - Fixed the `github_pullrequest` entity property `allCommitsApproved` so that it is only set if commits are available on a given pull request. If a repo is private, permissions do not allow J1 to pull the commit history.

### Hashicorp Vault
- Released a new integration for Hashicorp Vault. 

- The following entities are created:

      | Resources              | Entity `_type`                 | Entity `_class` |

      | Secret                 | `hashicorp_vault_secret`       | `Secret`        |
      | Secret Engine          | `hashicorp_vault_engine`       | `Service`       |
      | User                   | `hashicorp_vault_user`         | `User`          |

- The following relationships are created:

    | Source Entity `_type`          | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type`          |

    | `hashicorp_vault_account`      | **HAS**               | `hashicorp_vault_auth_backend` |
    | `hashicorp_vault_account`      | **HAS**               | `hashicorp_vault_engine`       |
    | `hashicorp_vault_account`      | **HAS**               | `hashicorp_vault_user`         |
    | `hashicorp_vault_auth_backend` | **HAS**               | `hashicorp_vault_user`         |
    | `hashicorp_vault_engine`       | **HAS**               | `hashicorp_vault_secret`       |

## Bug Fixes
-  Insights dashboards with variables have received a few fixes that resolve drill down issues and the run query function of a widget. 
-  Two bugs in widgets were resolved to enable you to toggle between multiple queries within a widget and delete a widget from the modal view. 
-  Resolved a bug related to J1 Policies where deleted procedures were still returning in query results. 
-  Downloading evidence from a control is updated due to a few issues with inconsistent downloads. 

## Coming Soon
- J1 Alerts is getting a design refresh! We are continuing our look-and-feel updates over J1 Alerts. 
- Leverage JupiterOne's knowledge in Insights with the J1 managed dashboards for security use cases that help you solve real problems. We are putting our knowledge front and center in the J1 Library. 
- Your J1 Query results will become more effective with upgrades to the table visualization and a new expandable entity drawer to help you dive into entities without leaving your J1 Query results tables or your graph view. The expanded entity drawer will provide J1 curated graph visualizations.
- No more silent failures for your alert rules: get notified when rules are not working, including an error log to help you triage and manage. 
- In the coming months, we will be updating the Questions Library, Homepage, and KPIs to make finding the right information and questions even easier.
