## Bug Fixes
-    The Home dashboard in J1 Insights can now be edited again by Insights admins.

## Coming Soon

- Alert trend lines will soon be updated to included rule errors, as well as each instance of the rule being evaluated. These updates allow you to see a holistic view of rules, evaluations, and the outcomes of actions (alerts). 
- Introducing: Asset Categories! J1 is reworking how assets are categorized, based on industry standards. These categorizes will persist throughout J1 to make searching and finding, the right information easier. 
- The home experience will become more flexible for your user groups by allowing you as an admin to publish J1 Insights dashboards to you and your user groups landing experience. 
- `csv` exports from query results and assets will soon be pushed to the notification panel to allow for larger exports and a single repository of your downloads. 
- AWS Config Recorder will soon be a fully supported and generally available service to all J1 users via the J1 Integrations section of the platform.
