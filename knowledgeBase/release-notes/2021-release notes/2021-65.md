# JupiterOne 2021.65 Release 

2021-02-24

Exciting new look and feel matching our redesigned branding and color scheme.
Lots of integration related work, performance improvements, UI/UX updates, and
bug fixes in additional to the rebranding.

## Integrations

### AWS

- Set `numericSeverity` on `aws_ecr_image_scan_finding` based on `severity` string.

- Set `open: true` on `aws_ecr_image_scan_finding` entities.

- Set `webLink` on `aws_ecr_image_scan_finding` to point to NVD website if the finding is a CVE.

- Updated `fullName` on `aws_ecr_image` entities to use digest when a tag is not defined.

- Built mapped relationships between any `Host`, `Function`, or `Container` that uses an `aws_ecr_image`.

- Captured the following properties to `aws_lambda_function` entities:

  `codeRepoType`, `codeLocation`, `codeImageUri` (with `containerImages` as an
  alias), `codeResolvedImageUri`, `concurrency`, `layers`, `packageType`, and
  `efsArns`.

  > This change requires an additional `Lambda.GetFunction` IAM permission.

- Built `aws_lambda_function_uses_layer` mapped relationships.

- Added `fqdn` to `aws_efs_file_system` entity.

### Azure

- Added support for **Diagnostic Settings**:

  - Network Load Balancers
  - Network Public IP Addresses
  - Network Virtual Networks
  - Network Firewalls

- Fixed `Virtual Networks` step failures when `Network Security Groups` step could not access some data.

### Bitbucket

- Added `createdOn` and `updatedOn` to `bitbucket_repo` entities.
- Fixed `404` error fetching details of a deleted repository.

### Checkmarx

- Initial release of Checkmarx integration (beta)! ðŸŽ‰

  > Check out the [docs](../docs/integrations/checkmarx/checkmarx.md) for details on
  > what's currently supported.

### GitHub

- Added `createdOn` and `updatedOn` to `github_repo` entities.
- Fixed `createAt`, renamed to `createdAt`.

### Google Cloud

- Added a number of managed questions to support CIS Benchmarks, more on the way! A few examples:

  - Are there Cloud KMS crypto keys that are publicly accessible?
  - Are Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) enabled for Cloud DNS?
  - Are my key-signing keys used in Cloud DNS DNSSEC using an insecure algorithm?
  - Are my zone-signing keys used in Cloud DNS DNSSEC using an insecure algorithm?
  - Are any of my Google Compute instances using the default service account with full access to all cloud APIs?

  > See them all in the 
  > [J1 Questions Library](https://ask.us.jupiterone.io/filter?integrations=google_cloud&tagFilter=all).

- Added support for `--skip-project-id-regex` in the `jupiterone-organization-setup` CLI.

- Added ingestion of the following **new** resources:

  | Service    | Resource / Entity                   |
  | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
  | Logging    | `google_logging_metric`             |
  |            | `google_logging_project_sink`       |
  |            | `google_monitoring_alert_policy`    |
  | Networking | `google_compute_health_check`       |
  |            | `google_compute_instance_group`     |
  |            | `google_compute_url_map`            |
  |            | `google_compute_backend_bucket`     |
  |            | `google_compute_target_ssl_proxy`   |
  |            | `google_compute_target_https_proxy` |
  |            | `google_compute_target_http_proxy`  |
  |            | `google_compute_ssl_policy`         |
  | Compute    | `google_compute_project`            |
  | GKE *      | `google_container_cluster`          |

  > _* GKE - Google Kubernetes Engine_

- Added new properties to various existing **Storage** resources:

  | Service | Resource / Entity       | Properties               |
  | ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
  | Storage | `google_storage_bucket` | `retentionPolicyEnabled` |
  |         |                         | `retentionPeriod`        |
  |         |                         | `retentionDate`          |
  | KMS     | `google_kms_crypto_key` | `public`                 |

- Fixed `fetch-compute-project` step failure when the service account used to
  execute the integration does not have the `compute.projects.get` permission.

### Jumpcloud

- Migrated integration to latest SDK and infrastructure for more reliable execution.
- Added `jumpcloud_account` **HAS** `jumpcloud_group` relationship.
- Fixed paginatation of group members.

### Microsoft 365

- Initial release of Microsoft 365 integration (beta)! ðŸŽ‰ 

  > Check out the [docs](../docs/integrations/microsoft365/index.md) for details
  > on what's currently supported.

### Qualys

- Host `Finding.targets` has been adjusted to include only `[detection.HOST.IP,
  assetHost.fqdn, assetHost.ec2InstanceArn]`; only `fqdn` and `ec2InstanceArn`
  will be used for mapping to the `Host` entity.

- Host `Finding` entities now have properties `fqdn`, `ec2InstanceArn`, used to
  map the `Finding` to the `Host` entities, which may be owned by other
  integrations (such as AWS).

### Rapid7

- Fixed client pagination logic that prevented ingestion of some vulnerabilities.

### Slack

- Fixed offsite authorization flow redirect URL to use subdomain instead of the account UUID.

## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- **Groups** tab in **User & Access** view loads more users in the list as with rolling (in sets of 20).
- Greatly improved the performance of Table Query Results across the app.
- Improved Policy and Procedure metadata fields UX.
- Fixed the size of the home icon in the Insights dashboard drawer.
- Fixed a bug where query input on Landing page becomes less responsive after several queries were run.
- Fixed a UI issue where the compliance neckbar had a scroll bar under certain circumstances.
- Fixed a bug with invalid character validation of the ID when editing a policy/procedure in the Policies app.
- Fixed an issue where the Compliance app may fail to load under certain circumstances for new accounts.

## Community Projects

- Added more sample Insights dashboards: 

  - [Software Package Dependencies and Licenses](https://github.com/JupiterOne/insights-dashboards/blob/main/boards/code-deps-licenses)
  - [Team Growth](https://github.com/JupiterOne/insights-dashboards/blob/main/boards/team-growth)
  - [User Training](https://github.com/JupiterOne/insights-dashboards/blob/main/boards/user-training)
  - [Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/JupiterOne/insights-dashboards/blob/main/boards/vuln-reporting)

- Open sourced a new tool `peril` from JupiterOne Security Team:

  `Peril` is a standalone CLI tool intended to analyze the overall risk
  profile for the currently-checked-out branch of a code repository. It will
  draw risk information from a configurable list of sources, including
  JupiterOne, before calculating and rendering an overall risk verdict for the
  code.

  > We use `peril` internally at JupiterOne as part of our appsec and secure
  > CI/CD process.
