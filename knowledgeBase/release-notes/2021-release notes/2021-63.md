# JupiterOne 2021.63 Release

2021-01-27

_Lots of focus on bug fixes this sprint._ 

## New Features

- Added new **collapsed state** to the menu/navigation panel on the left side of
  the **Insights** and **Compliance** apps. This provides clearer visual of the
  additional dashboards, benchmarks, compliance standards, and security
  questionnaires that are available in the app.

- Improved query results UI so that they now use more of the available white
  space on the page
