## New Features and Improvements

- Added a **Markdown widget** to the **Insights** app that allows static HTML content 
  to be added to any Insights board.

- Updated the **Owners & Maintainers** tab in the **Vulnerabilities** view to show the 
  query if no results were returned.

- Improved UI/UX of the **Policies** app with a more intuitive layout of the 
  domains/policies and the controls/procedures for each domain.

- Customers who have purchased the "Powerup Pack" or are at the Enterprise tier can 
  now upload a **custom logo** for their J1 instance. The custom logo will be
  displayed in the main app UI and used in the policies PDF export.
