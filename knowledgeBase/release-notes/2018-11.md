# JupiterOne 2018.11 Release

2018-10-04

## New Features

- **AWS Integration Multi-Region** is now supported. JupiterOne will now ingest and analyze resources across all regions by default. This is automatically enabled and there is no change needed on your side. This will enable you to see any resource that is potentially misplaced or malicious in a region you did not intend to use.

- **In-app Help and Guides** is now available. It can be activated via the Help Menu at the top navigation bar.

## Improvements

- Backend and infrastructure stability improvements
- Improved error handling
- Captured additional properties from AWS EC2 instances
