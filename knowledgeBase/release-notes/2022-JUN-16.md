# JupiterOne 16 June 2022 Release

## New Features and Improvements
- J1 Assets has a new look-and-feel, which includes a new filtering pane and changes to how you search and filter. 
- In J1 Policies, a complete history of policy and procedure changes over a specified timeframe are now available for download in `.csv format`. This enhancement enables easy access to the audit history of changes made to your policies over time. 
-  For Insights dashboards, you can now restrict access to a dashboard link based on an IP address range or set or ranges so that you can limit sharing to your organizations.

## Bug Fixes
-  Resolved an issue with submitting feedback directly via the JJ1 platform.
-  Fixed a bug with J1 Insights where whole number values were not displaying accurately.
-  Resolved a problem when adding additional dashboards from templates in Insights.
-  Fixed an issue that occurred when creating a custom property on an asset, a property was created for every letter added.
-  Fixed a bug with scoped frameworks in J1 Compliance that prevented tag properties from being used as the filter for frameworks.
-  Resolved a bug related to alert emails not being triggered.
-  Resolved a bug that produced incorrect results when adding more than one COUNT in a multi-traversal query (such as. FIND Host THAT HAS Finding RETURN Host.displayName, COUNT(Host), COUNT(Finding)).

## Integrations

### AWS

- Fixed an issue that was causing the relationship between `aws_elasticache_cluster` 
  and `aws_elasticache_snapshot` to not be created.
- Improved the retry logic to improve the resiliency for larger accounts.
- The EC2 VPN Gateway to Customer Gateway relationship's outsideIpAddresses
  field is updated to a concatenated string, delimited by commas.
  Relationship properties cannot be arrays.
- By default, after the API bulk fetches `aws_instance` or `aws_ebs_snapshot`
  assets, it attempts to get additional detailed information about each asset
  with another API call per asset. However, this causes a peformance problem
  when the number of these assets grows very large. Now, when more than 1000
  `aws_instance` or `aws_ebs_snapshot` assets are fetched, the integration
  skips the follow-up API calls for additional information. For `aws_instance`
  assets, this results in the disablement of the 'userData' derived properties
  `secretsDetectedInUserData`, `hasSecrets`, and `secretsDetected`. For
  `aws_ebs_snapshot` assets, this results in the disablement of the
  'createVolumePermission' derived properties `public`, `shared`,
  `sharedWithAccounts` and `restorableByUserIds`. An event is published to users
  warning of this change.
- VPC peering relationships occasionally generate "Duplicate Key" errors because
  the peering relationship may sometimes be derived by integration from both
  sides of the peering. These errors are now caught so that the step does not
  fail.
- In the case of KMS keys that did not use aliases, the integration was not
  always successfully building `aws_ec2` USES `aws_kms_key` relationships to
  those keys. This is now fixed.

| Resources                    | Entity `_type`         | Entity `_class` |
