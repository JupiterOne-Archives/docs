# JupiterOne 8 September 2022 Release

## New Features and Improvements
- You can now edit query results directly from the query, including the ability to select multiple results at once. The supported actions you can take are `setting tags` and `setting owners`. With these actions, assign asset ownership directly from a query and tag entities without navigating throughout the platform. 
- Select Insight widgets now support the ability to drill down, showing you all related information from the query that powers the attribute within the widget. 
- View the graph for an asset directly from the Asset Details Page, including additional graph views to see the scope of impact for an asset, if applicable. 
- The View Details page now opens in the same tab, rather than a new one. 
## Integrations
