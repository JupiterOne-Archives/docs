# JupiterOne 2 March 2023 Release

## New Features and Improvements
-  Your J1 Insights dashboards are now equipped with pagination in the `data-table`. This change makes your dashboards load quicker and provides a uniform `data-table` experience throughout J1. 
-  The expandable properties panel with the preset graph views is now available when inspecting entities in the graph canvas. 
- All your `csv` exports links are now sent to the notification panel, which will allow you to move throughout your J1 workflows and get notified when your `csv` is ready to be download.

- Set compliance requirement applicability at the top level, giving you greater control over your compliance posture for your unique security needs. For requirements marked as `not applicable`, you can now provide the business justification with J1, saving time and providing clarity.

- The alert trend in your Alerts modal is updated to provide detailed information on the status of the rule that powers the alert outcome. The trend shows when an alert was triggered, the result count, as well as when a rule failed to evaluate.
