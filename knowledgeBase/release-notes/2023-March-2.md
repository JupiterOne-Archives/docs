- Introducing: Asset Categories! J1 is reworking how assets are categorized, based on industry standards. These categorizes will persist throughout J1 to make searching and finding, the right information easier. 
- The home experience will become more flexible for your user groups by allowing you as an admin to publish J1 Insights dashboards to you and your user groups landing experience. 
- `csv` exports from query results and assets will soon be pushed to the notification panel to allow for larger exports and a single repository of your downloads. 
- AWS Config Recorder will soon be a fully supported and generally available service to all J1 users via the J1 Integrations section of the platform.
- Alert rules will soon alert on new results only, reducing duplicates from queries and cutting through the noise to highlight what is important and what needs your attention.
