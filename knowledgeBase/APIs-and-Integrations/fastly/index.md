# Integration with JupiterOne

## Fastly + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize Fastly users, API tokens, services, and service backends in the
  JupiterOne graph.
- Map Fastly users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
- Monitor changes to Fastly users and API tokens using JupiterOne alerts.
- Monitor changes to Fastly services and service backends using JupiterOne
  alerts.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches users, tokens, and services from Fastly to
  update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph, or
  leverage existing queries.
- Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes, or leverage
  existing alerts.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires a Fastly customer ID and API token to interact with the
  API.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Integration Walkthrough

### In Fastly

To conigure this integration you should have an account in Fastly and create an
**API Token** with Read-only access (`global:read`). You will also need the
**Customer ID** from the settings page of your Fastly account.

- The **Customer ID** can be obtained from
  https://manage.fastly.com/account/company

- The **API Token** can be created from
  https://manage.fastly.com/account/personal/tokens

### In JupiterOne

1. From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to the **Fastly** integration tile and click it.
3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

- Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this Fastly account
  in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
  `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
- Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
  the integration instance.
- Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
  needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
- Enter the **Customer ID** associated with your Fastly account.
- Enter the **API Token** generated from your Fastly account (by a superuser so
  it is associated with the organization, not the user) with global read
  permissions.

4. Click **Create Configuration** once all values are provided.
