# Integration with JupiterOne

## Feroot + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize Feroot users, groups, project folders, projects, alerts, and 
domains in the JupiterOne graph.
- Map Feroot users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
- Monitor changes to Feroot users and groups using JupiterOne alerts.
- Monitor changes to Feroot project folders and projects using JupiterOne alerts.
- Monitor Feroot findings within the alerts app.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches users, groups, and other security testing 
resources from Feroot to update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph, or leverage
 existing queries.
- Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes, or leverage 
existing alerts.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires a Feroot API Key to interact with the API.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Integration Walkthrough

### In Feroot

To create an account in Feroot just sign up on
[feroot.com](https://www.feroot.com). To get access to the API Key management
functionality the `PRO` plan subscription is required. You can start a free
trial of `PRO` plan by clicking on `Start PRO trial` link in your account.

To create an API key go to `Settings` -> `Account` -> `Developer` and click
`Create new API key`. Select `Admin Read-only` role for the new key. The new
item will be added to `List of API keys` table. Click on `Reveal API key` and
copy the key to use in the integration.

### In JupiterOne

1. From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to the **Feroot** integration tile and click it.
3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:
- Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this Feroot
   account in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
   `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
- Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
   the integration instance.
- Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
   needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.

admin read-only role.
