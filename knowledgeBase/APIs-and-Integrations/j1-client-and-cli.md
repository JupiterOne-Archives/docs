# JupiterOne Node.js Client and CLI

JupiterOne is a data driven platform. It is easy to add your own data that is
not covered by out-of-the-box managed integrations.

We provide a node.js API client wrapper and a CLI utility on [Github][1].

The CLI supports uploading entities in either JSON or YAML format. This guide -
[Using JupiterOne as a central repository for SecOps and compliance artifacts][2]
provides an example use case.
