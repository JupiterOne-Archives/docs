# JupiterOne Bulk Upload Schema

> IMPORTANT: Bulk upload triggers a data synchronization process that
> automatically **updates** or **deletes** entities/relationships as needed.
> Previously existing entities/relationships within the same `scope` that no
> longer exist in the latest upload will be marked for deletion. 
> 
> Therefore, the upload file should always include the **complete** set of
> entities or relationships within the defined `scope` to avoid unintended data
> deletion.
> 
> In the UI, users are prompted to select/enter a `scope` when uploading a file.
>
> Via the API, `scope` is provided when starting a synchronization job.
> 
> **For example:**
>
> ```text
> POST /persister/synchronization/jobs
> ```
>
> ```json
> {
>   "source": "api",
>   "scope": "my-sync-job"
> }
> ```
>
> See [API doc](../jupiterone-api.md#entityandrelationshipsynchronization) for more details.
