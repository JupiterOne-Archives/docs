## What SSH keys exist on system {}?

Find all SSH keys in an AWS account:

```j1ql
Find aws_key_pair with tag.AccountName='{accountName}'
```

You can also use the abstract class:

```j1ql
Find AccessKey with usage='ssh' and tag.AccountName='{accountName}'
```

Find key usage and return a graph:

```j1ql
Find aws_key_pair that relates to Host return tree
```

Find key usage and return a table with specific properties:

```j1ql
Find aws_key_pair as key that relates to Host as h
return key.displayName,
  h.displayName, h.instanceId, h.region, h.classification, h.tag.AccountName
```

_The linkage will be mapped when we start processing cloudtrail events._
