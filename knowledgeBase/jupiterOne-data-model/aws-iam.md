# JupiterOne Data Model for AWS IAM Access and Trusts

The Identity and Access Model that we have created for the JupiterOne AWS integration shows which entities are ingested and the relationships that are created. A graph view of this is available in your JupiterOne account after you turn on the AWS integration and starting ingesting data to your account.
