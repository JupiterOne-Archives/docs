# JupiterOne Data Model for AWS IAM Access and Trusts

The Identity and Access Model for the JupiterOne AWS integration shows which assets are ingested and the relationships that are created. A graph view of this model is available in your JupiterOne account after you turn on the AWS integration and starting ingesting data to your account.
