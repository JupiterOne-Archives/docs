# JupiterOne Data Model for Network and Endpoint Infrastructure

As we build integrations for network and endpoint protection products we start with this reference model and attempt to collect these types of entities and map these kinds of relationships so that customers using these products will be able to use the same queries for any network or endpoint product integrated with JupiterOne.  Based on the product and what is available to JupiterOne for import, adjustments are made that will be unique to each product.
