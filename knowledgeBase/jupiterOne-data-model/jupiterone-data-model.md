# JupiterOne Data Model

The **JupiterOne Data Model** is a reference model used to describe digital resources and the complex interconnections among all the resources in a technology organization as an **entity-relationship graph**.

The data model is defined by a set of Entities and their Relationships. It represents a reference model, not a strict or rigid structure.

## Entity

An Entity is a node/vertex in the graph that represents a resource within your digital infrastructure.

See the full data model schema in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/JupiterOne/data-model).

### Class and Type of an Entity

Each Entity has a specific **type** that defines what that entity is, and is assigned one or more higher level **class** that represents a more abstract categorization or labeling of the entity in the perspective of security and technical operations.

#### Type

The **type** property represents the specific type that entity is as defined by the source. For example, an AWS resource may be of type `aws_instance` or `aws_s3_bucket` or `aws_iam_user`.

#### Class

The **class** of an entity is considered an abstract, super-type that defines what that entity is within the general framework of IT and security operations. In the above example, an `aws_instance` entity has a class of `Host`, while an `aws_s3_bucket` is a `DataStore`, and an `aws_iam_user` a `User`.

### Common Entity Properties

Most Entities will have the following common properties:

    `status`           | `string` | Status of this entity set by the external source system or by a user, e.g. Active, Inactive, Decommissioned
    `active`           | `boolean` | Indicates if this entity is currently active.
    `public`           | `boolean` | Indicates if this is a public-facing resource (e.g. a public IP or public DNS record) or if the entity is publicly accessible. Default is false.
    `validated`        | `boolean` | Indicates if this node has been validated as a known/valid Entity.
    `temporary`        | `boolean` | Indicates if this node is a temporary resource, such as a lambda instance or an EC2 instance started by ECS.
    `trusted`          | `boolean` | Indicates if this is a trusted resource. For example, a trusted Network, Host, Device, Application, Person, User, or Vendor.
    `createdOn`        | `number` | The timestamp (in milliseconds since epoch) when the entity was created at the source. This is different than `_createdOn` which is the timestamp the entity was first ingested into JupiterOne.

    `owner`            | `string` | The owner of this entity. This could reference the name of the owner, or as reference ID/key to another entity in the graph as the owner.
    `tags`             | `array` | An array of unnamed tags
    `notes`            | `array` | User provided notes about this entity
</details>
<!--END Common Entity Properties table-->

### Class Specific Entity Properties

Each specific class of Entity also has its own defined properties. For example, a `Person` entity will have properties including `firstName` and `lastName`, while a `Device` entity may have properties such as `hardwareVendor`, `hardwareModel`, and `hardwareSerial`.

### Custom Properties

Entities can also have custom properties that are specific to the type of that entity, defined by the source system where the resource belongs to, or defined by the individual or team managing the resource.

### Defined Entities

Here is a list of reference entities defined by the JupiterOne Data Model, each with its own defined set of properties in addition to the shared common properties:

    `Policy`           | A written policy documentation.

    `Review`           | A review record.
    `Risk`             | An object that represents an identified Risk as the result of an Assessment. The collection of Risk objects in JupiterOne make up the Risk Register. A Control may have a `MITIGATES` relationship to a Risk.

    `Rule`             | An operational or configuration compliance rule, often part of a Ruleset.
    `Ruleset`          | An operational or configuration compliance ruleset with rules that govern (or enforce, evaluate, monitor) a security control or IT system.

    `ThreatIntel`      | Threat intelligence captures information collected from vulnerability risk analysis by those with substantive expertise and access to all-source information. Threat intelligence helps a security professional determine the risk of a vulnerability finding to their organization.
    `Training`         | A training module, such as a security awareness training or secure development training.
    `User`             | A user account/login to access certain systems and/or services. Examples include okta-user, aws-iam-user, ssh-user, local-user (on a host), etc.
    `UserGroup`        | A user group, typically associated with some type of access control, such as a group in Okta or in Office365. If a UserGroup has an access policy attached, and all member Users of the UserGroup would inherit the policy.

    `Vendor`           | An external organization that is a vendor or service provider.
    `Vulnerability`    | A security vulnerability (application or system or infrastructure). A single vulnerability may relate to multiple findings and impact multiple resources. The `IMPACTS` relationship between the Vulnerability and the resource entity that was impacted serves as the record of the finding. The `IMPACTS` relationship carries properties such as 'identifiedOn', 'remediatedOn', 'remediationDueOn', 'issueLink', etc.
    `Weakness`         | A security weakness.
    `Workload`         | A virtual compute instance, it could be an aws-ec2-instance, a docker-container, an aws-lambda-function, an application-process, or a vmware-instance. The exact workload type is described in the _type property of the Entity.

#### Special Entities

There are three special entities defined. These are singleton entities.

| Entity     | Description                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `Everyone` | The global `UserGroup` that represents "everyone" publicly. |
| `Internet` | The Internet -- i.e. a `Network` entity with CIDR `"0.0.0.0/0"`. |
| `Root`     | The entity that represents the top level organization. |

## Relationships

A relationship is the edge between two entity nodes in the graph. The `_class` of the relationship should be, in most cases, a generic descriptive verb, such as `HAS` or `IMPLEMENTS`.

Relationships can also carry their own properties.

For example, `CodeRepo -- DEPLOYED TO -> Host` may have `version` as a property on the `DEPLOYED` relationship. This represents the mapping between a code repo to multiple deployment targets, while one deployment may be of a different version of the code than another. Storing the version as a relationship
property allows us to avoid duplicate instances of the code repo entity to be created to represent different versions.

Relationships have the same metadata properties as entities, which are managed by the integration providers.
