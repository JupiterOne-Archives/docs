## Standards, Sections, Requirements

Standards are, broadly, compliance frameworks, regulations, or industry best practices. Standards can be used interchangeably with the synonymous term frameworks.

    Examples of standards include: HIPAA, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, FedRAMP, NIST CSF, CIS Benchmarks, etc.

> A standard is a collection of requirements grouped by sections, or a collection of controls grouped by domains.

Sections can be considered as parts or components of a standard. 

    Examples of sections include: HIPAA Physical Safeguards (§164.310), ISO 27001 Clause 6, PCI-DSS Requirement 8, the Access Control (AC) Family within FedRAMP, CIS Basics 2. Inventory of Software Assets, etc.

> A standard _has_ one or more sections. A section _has_ one or more requirements. 

Requirements comprise sections of a standard. Individual requirements outline the specification that needs to be met. 

    Examples of requirements include: HIPAA §164.310(a)(1)(i), ISO 27001 6.1.3 a, PCI-DSS 8.4.b, FedRAMP AC-2 (7), utilizing application whitelisting to implement CIS Basics 2.7, etc..

When thinking through different regulatory or compliance standards/frameworks, the idea of a standard _having_ one or more sections, which _have_ one or more requirements is equivalent to a framework _having_ one or more domains, which _have_ one or more controls.

## Policies, procedures, controls, control policies/configurations, vendors

You can think of an organization’s policies, procedures, and controls to loosely align to the compliance or regulatory standards, sections, and requirements.

Another way of looking at it would be: **policies** + **procedures** reflect you organization's internal view of how to run security, which is demonstrated to external stakeholders via the compliance implementation of
**standards/sections/requirements** or **framework/domains/controls**.

At JupiterOne, we have an internal **framework** of **controls**. How we do security is reflected in our **policies** + **procedures** within the [**Policies** app](https://j1.apps.us.jupiterone.io/policies/overview). **Policies** map to **domains**, **procedures** map to **controls**. Conversely,
those same internal JupiterOne **policies, procedures, and controls** satisfy external regulatory/compliance **standards, sections, and requirements** in the [**Compliance** app](https://j1.apps.us.jupiterone.io/compliance).  

**Policies** are high-level statements of management intent; they are written security documents which frequently satisfy external requirements. 

    Examples of policies include: access management policies, data protection policies, human resource policies.

> **Policies** are _implemented_ by **procedures**. 

**Procedures** are written security documents which describe how to implement policies via technology or processes, or a combination of the two; the ‘who’, ‘what’, ‘when’, ‘how’, etc; they can be
thought of as control or process descriptions. 

Examples of procedures (aka control/process descriptions) include: 

- password management
- protecting data at rest 
- employee screening

> **Policies** are _implemented_ by **procedures**; **controls** _implement_ **procedures**. 

**Controls** are the technical, administrative, and physical safeguards that enforce the procedures; they can manifest commonly as a process managed by a person/team or as a product/service provided by a vendor. 

Examples of controls include: 

- user identity management, access control, multi-factor authentication
- data encryption at rest or in transit
- penetration testing, code scanning
- pre-employment background checks.

> A `ControlPolicy` or `Configuration` _enforces_ or _manages_ a `Control`.

**Control Policies** or **configurations** are the technical settings whereby controls are implemented. 

Examples of control policies or configurations include: 

- requiring 12+ characters including a number + a symbol for all passwords
- using AES-256 cipher for encryption at rest
- for background checks, specifically include searches for federal, criminal, state, county, city, financial, and education verification

> **Vendors** _provide_ **controls**. 

Vendors are frequently companies, organizations, or people that provide the controls.

Examples of vendors include:

- Microsoft (the Vendor) for Active Directory (AD), user authentication, and access control
- Amazon Web Services (AWS, the Vendor) for Key Management Service (KMS)
- Checkr (the Vendor) for background screens

> **Policies** are _implemented_ by **procedures**; **controls** _implement_ **procedures**. A **control Policy** or **configuration** _enforces_ or _manages_ a **control**.

> **Policies** are _implemented_ by **procedures**; **controls** _implement procedures**. **Vendors** _provide_ **controls**.
