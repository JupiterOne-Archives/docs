## Integration Walkthrough

### In Whois

The integration instance configuration expects a comma separated lists of
domains. For example:

```
google.com,facebook.com
```

### In JupiterOne

1. From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to the **Whois** integration tile and click it.
3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:
- Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this Whois
   account in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
   `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
- Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
   the integration instance.
- Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
   needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
- Enter the **Domains** as a comma separated list that JupiterOne will lookup.
4. Click **Create Configuration** once all values are provided.
