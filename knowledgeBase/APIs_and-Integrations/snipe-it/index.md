# Snipe-IT Integration with JupiterOne

## Snipe-IT + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize Snipe-IT account locations, hardware, and hardware owners in the
  JupiterOne graph.
- Map Snipe-IT users to the hardware they have or own.
- Monitor changes to locations, hardware, and hardware owners using using
  JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches Snipe-IT hardware and owners data to update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
- Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires the hostname of your Snipe-IT account as well as an 
  API Token configured for read access.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.
