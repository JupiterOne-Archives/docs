# JumpCloud Integration with JupiterOne

## JumpCloud + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize JumpCloud users, groups, and applications in the JupiterOne graph.
- Map JumpCloud users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
- Monitor changes to JumpCloud users and groups using JupiterOne alerts.
- Create an employee entity that is used to map users across your organization
  to an employee via a matching email property.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches JumpCloud users and SSO assets to update the
  graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
- Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires an API key used to authenticate with the JumpCloud
  account.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

  the integration instance.

  needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
