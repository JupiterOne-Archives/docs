## Integration Walkthrough

### In Wazuh

JupiterOne provides a managed integration with [Wazuh][1]. The integration
connects directly to Wazah Manager APIs to obtain agent information. Customers
authorize access to their self-hosted servers by providing the manager base URL
and a username and password to JupiterOne.

### In JupiterOne

2. Scroll to the **Wazuh** integration tile and click it.
3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

- Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this Wazuh account
  in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
  `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
- Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
  the integration instance.
- Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
  needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
- Enter the **Manager URL**, or the Wazuh API base URL.
- Enter the **Username** used to authenticate with the Wazuh Manager.
