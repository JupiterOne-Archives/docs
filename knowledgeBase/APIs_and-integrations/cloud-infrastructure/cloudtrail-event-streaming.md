# CloudTrail Event Streaming with the AWS Integration

The AWS integration can continuously update the graph using CloudTrail events streamed over EventBridge. 

To enable this feature, first contact the JupiterOne development team either via the community Slack or by creating a support ticket. Provide the AWS account ID of the account from which you'd like to stream events to JupiterOne and the region of the CloudTrail that will be producing the events. The JupiterOne
development team will add your AWS account to the list of those permitted to send events to the AWS integration's event bus.

Once the JupiterOne development team has confirmed with you that your account has been added to the list of permitted accounts, create a rule on your AWS account's default event bus that targets the AWS integration's event bus. If you're unsure of how to do this, you can follow the instructions in the [AWS
integration's CloudFormation project on GitHub](https://github.com/JupiterOne/jupiterone-aws-cloudformation#jupiterone-aws-cloudformation).

If you set up your event rule to send events to JupiterOne using the CloudFormation provided by JupiterOne, it will be configured to only send events that the AWS integration can actually interpret. This is achieved by listing the supported CloudTrail events' names in the event rule's `EventPattern`. Any events sent to JupiterOne will be charged to the sending account (yours) so if you don't care about a subset of events that JupiterOne supports, you should consider removing them from your rule's event pattern. On the other hand, when JupiterOne adds support for more events, you will need to add those events' names to your rule's event pattern.

See the article ["Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html) in the AWS EventBridge documentation for more details.
