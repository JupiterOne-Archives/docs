# Bitbucket Integration with JupiterOne

## Bitbucket + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize Bitbucket workspaces, projects, repositories, pull requests, and users in the JupiterOne graph.
- Bitbucket users will be mapped to employees in your JupiterOne account.
- Monitor changes to Bitbucket users using JupiterOne alerts.
- Produce compliance evidence using Bitbucket Pull Requests ingested into
  JupiterOne.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches workspaces, projects, repositories, pull
  requests, and users from Bitbucket to update the graph.
- The Bitbucket user will be mapped to employees by matching
  `bitbucket_user.nickname === Person.bitbucketNickname`.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
- Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires a Bitbucket OAuth Consumer in the target Workspace. You
  need permission to create an OAuth Consumer.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.
