# Duo

## Duo + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize Duo users, groups, devices, applications, and access keys in the
  JupiterOne graph.
- Map Duo users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
- Monitor changes to Duo users, groups, and access management data using
  JupiterOne alerts.
- Create an employee entity that is used to map users across your organization
  to an employee via a matching email property.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches Duo users, groups, and access management data
  to update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
- Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires the Duo API hostname. JupiterOne also requires the API
  integration key and API secret key that have been configured for read access.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Support

If you need help with this integration, please contact
[JupiterOne Support](https://support.jupiterone.io).

## Integration Walkthrough

### In Duo

You will need to create an API key (`Integration Key` + `Secret Key`) from your
Duo Admin Panel. You may need to contact Duo Support to request API access. See
up-to-date instructions in [Duo Support Docs][1].

#### Required API Permissions

JupiterOne requires at a minimum the following API permissions be enabled:

- Grant administrators
- Grant settings
- Grant read resource

### In JupiterOne

1. From the top navigation of the J1 Search homepage, select **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to the **Duo** integration tile and click it.
3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

- Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this Duo account in
  JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in `tag.AccountName`
  when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
- Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
  the integration instance.
- Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
  needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
- Enter the **API Hostname** of your Duo account.
- Enter the **API Integration Key** configured with read access in Duo.
- Enter the **Secret Key** configured with read access in Duo.

4. Click **Create Configuration** once all values are provided.
