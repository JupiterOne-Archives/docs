# JupiterOne Node.js Client and CLI

JupiterOne is a data driven platform. It is easy to add your own data that is not covered by out-of-the-box managed integrations. 

We provide a node.js API client wrapper and a CLI utility on [Github](https://github.com/JupiterOne/jupiterone-client-nodejs).

The CLI supports uploading entities in either JSON or YAML format. This guide - [Using JupiterOne as a central repository for SecOps and compliance artifacts](../../security-operations/secops-artifacts-in-j1.md) provides an example use case.
