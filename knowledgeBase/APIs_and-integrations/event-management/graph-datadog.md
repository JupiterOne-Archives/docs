# Datadog

## Datadog + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize Datadog services, hosts, teams, and users in the JupiterOne graph.
- Map Datadog users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
- Monitor changes to Datadog users using JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches services, hosts, teams, and users from Datadog
  to update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph, or
  leverage existing queries.
- Configure alerts to take action when JupiterOne graph changes, or leverage
  existing alerts.

## Requirements

- Datadog supports authentication via an API key and an application key.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Integration Walkthrough

### In Datadog

1. Register for a Datadog account.
2. Create an API key by going to
   https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/api-keys. (click on 'New Key'
   at the top right corner). The account must have the "Datadog Admin Role" to
   be able to generate an API key.
3. Create an application key by going to
   https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/application-keys. (click on
   'New Key' at the top right corner). An account with any role can generate
   application key. Leave the key as Not Scoped.
4. Take note of these credentials and supply them to the integration's
   [.env file](../env.example).

### In JupiterOne

1. From the top navigation of the J1 Search homepage, select **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to the **Datadog** integration tile and click it.
3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

- Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this Datadog
  account in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
  `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
- Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
  the integration instance.
- Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
  needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
- Enter the **Datadog API Key** generated for use by JupiterOne.
- Optionally, enter the Datadog organization ID for your organization. You can
  find this by sending a GET request to the endpoint listed at https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/organizations/#list-your-managed-organizations.

4. Click **Create Configuration** once all values are provided.
