# Zoom

## Zoom + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize Zoom user, user settings, roles, and groups in the JupiterOne graph.
- Map Zoom users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
- Monitor changes to ingested Zoom resources using JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches user, user settings, roles, and groups from
  Zoom to update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph, or
  leverage existing queries.
- Configure alerts to take action when JupiterOne graph changes, or leverage
  existing alerts.

## Requirements

- Zoom supports the Server-to-Server OAuth2 Client Credential flow. A Zoom pro
  account is optional but is highly recommended.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Integration Walkthrough

### In Zoom

1. In the Zoom App Marketplace, go to the Develop dropdown menu in the 
   top-right corner and select [Build App](https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/create).
2. Click 'Create' under the Server-to-Server OAuth app type.
3. Enter an app name to begin creation.
4. Take note of your `Account ID`, `Client ID`, and `Client secret` and supply
   it to the .env file.
5. Supply the required information for each section. Zoom will prompt you if any
   required fields are omitted.
6. On scopes, add `group:read:admin`, `role:read:admin`, `user:read:admin`, and
   `account:read:admin`. If you cannot or choose not to provide all the listed
   scopes the steps requiring the missing scopes will be disabled.
7. On the final screen once all required information has been provided, an
   `Activate your app` button will appear. Click it to complete app creation.

### In JupiterOne

3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:
   - Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this Zoom

   - Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
     the integration instance.
   - Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your
     monitoring needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the
