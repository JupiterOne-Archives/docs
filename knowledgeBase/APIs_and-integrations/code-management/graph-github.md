# GitHub Integration with JupiterOne

## GitHub + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

**GitHub Enterprise Server is now supported**

*   Visualize GitHub users, teams, code repositories, pull requests, issues,
    installed GitHub applications, organizational secrets, repo secrets, repo
    environments, and environmental secrets in the JupiterOne graph.
*   Map GitHub users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
*   Map GitHub users to development/security trainings.
*   Monitor Github software development activities within repositories including
    changes, reviews and approvals.
*   Monitor changes to GitHub user teams, users, code repositories, and pull
    requests using JupiterOne alerts.
*   Monitor installations of GitHub Apps using JupiterOne alerts.
*   Monitor and audit outside collaborators on code repositories.

## How it Works

*   JupiterOne periodically fetches installed GitHub `apps`, `users`, `teams`,
    `code repositories`, and recently created/changed `pull requests` and `issues`
    in those repositories to update the graph.
*   Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
*   Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes.

### **Note on `issues` and `pull requests`:**

The integration limits ingestion of `pull requests` and `issues` during each
execution to 500 of the most recently created/modified *since the last
execution*. This is an accumulative process resulting in existing `issues` and
`pull requests` which have been ingested, but are not changing, remain in the
graph.

## Requirements

*   JupiterOne requires the JupiterOne GitHub app with read-only permissions be
    installed in your Github Organization account.
*   You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.
*   If setting up for GitHub Enterprise Server, the URL to your instance is
    required.

## Integration Walk-through

### In GitHub

Upon creating a new GitHub integration configuration in JupiterOne, the user is
re-directed to GitHub to install the JupiterOne GitHub App. The App will request
read-only permissions to support ingestion of
[entities and relationships](#data-model).

#### Repository Permissions

*   Actions: Read-only
*   Environments: Read-only
*   Metadata: Read-only
*   Pull requests: Read-only
*   Issues: Read-only (enables both Issues and private-repo PRs)
*   [Secrets](#secrets-caveat): Read-only
*   Dependabot alerts: Read-only

#### Organization Permissions

*   Members: Read-only
*   Administration: Read-only
*   [Secrets](#secrets-caveat): Read-only

#### User Permissions

*   None

#### Secrets Caveat

Note that the Secrets API does not reveal the values of Secrets - only their
names and creation dates.

### In JupiterOne

1.  From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2.  Scroll to the **GitHub** integration tile and click it.
3.  Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:
    *   Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this GitHub
        account in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
        `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
    *   Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
        the integration instance.
    *   Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your
        monitoring needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the
        integration.
4.  Click **Create Configuration** once all values are provided.

## Hierarchy of Steps

This integration uses many steps to retrieve data. Some of the steps depend on
others. If there is a crash or error, it might be helpful to understand the
hierarchy of step dependency.

*   The root step is `fetch-account`. All other steps depend on it.
*   There are four steps that depend only on `fetch-account`. These are
    `fetch-apps`, `fetch-repos`, `fetch-users`, and `fetch-teams`. These could be
    considered primary steps.
*   Other steps logically require multiple primary steps to complete. Examples
    include `fetch-collaborators`, `fetch-team-members`, and `fetch-team-repos`.
*   Finally, some sophisticated steps require both primary steps and secondary
    steps before they can execute. For example, `fetch-prs` needs both
    `fetch-repos` and `fetch-collaborators` in order to properly label reviewers
    and approvers.

## How to Uninstall

1.  From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2.  Scroll to the **GitHub** integration tile and click it.
3.  Identify and click the **integration to delete**.
4.  Click the **trash can** icon.
5.  Click the **Remove** button to delete the integration.
