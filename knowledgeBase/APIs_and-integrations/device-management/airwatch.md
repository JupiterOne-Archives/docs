# VMware AirWatch Integration with JupiterOne

## AirWatch Integration Benefits

- Visualize VMware AirWatch admins, users, groups, and devices in the JupiterOne graph.
- Map VMware AirWatch users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
- Monitor changes to VMware AirWatch admins, users, groups, and devices using JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches users and devices from VMware AirWatch to update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph, or leverage existing queries.
- Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes, or leverage existing alerts.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires a VMware AirWatch hostname, admin username and password, and rest API key to interact with the API.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Integration Walkthrough

### In VMware AirWatch

After logging into VMware AirWatch (Workspace ONE™️ UEM), create an Administrator user account for the integration to authenticate with the REST API.

1. Select **Accounts** > **Administrators** > **List View**.

2. Press the **Add** > **Add Admin**" button and provide required details. It is _recommended_ that you set values representing JupiterOne as a system user account. It is _important_ that you set _Title_ on the _Details_ tab to
   "system" so that JupiterOne understands this is a user for automation (it will not attempt to map to a Person entity).

3. Once the account is created, navigate to **Groups & Settings** > **All Settings** > **System** > **Advanced** > **API** > **REST API**" and click **Add** to create a new API key.

### In JupiterOne

1. From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to the **VMware AirWatch** integration tile and click it.
3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

- Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this VMware AirWatch account in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
- Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying the integration instance.
- Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
- Enter the **Hostname** of your VMware AirWatch account.
- Enter the **Admin Username** used to authenticate with VMware Airwatch.
- Enter the **Admin Password** associated with the username.
- Enter the **Rest API Key** (or Tenant Code) used to authenticate with VMware Airwatch.

4. Click **Create Configuration** once all values are provided.

## How to Uninstall

1. From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to the **VMware AirWatch** integration tile and click it.
3. Identify and click the **integration to delete**.
4. Click the **trash can** icon.
5. Click the **Remove** button to delete the integration.
