# WhiteHat Integration with JupiterOne

## WhiteHat Security + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

*   Visualize WhiteHat scans, cves, vulnerabilities, and findings in the
    JupiterOne graph.
*   Map WhiteHat findings to a code repo, project, or application in your
    JupiterOne account.
*   Monitor WhiteHat cves, findings, and vulnerabilities within the alerts app.
*   Monitor changes to WhiteHat scans using JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

*   JupiterOne periodically fetches WhiteHat scans and findings to update the
    graph.
*   Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
*   Configure alerts to reduce the noise of findings.
*   Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes.

## Requirements

*   JupiterOne requires an API key to authenticate with WhiteHat.
*   You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

password and copy the displayed API Key.

### In JupiterOne

1.  From the configuration **Gear Icon**, select **Integrations**.
2.  Scroll to the **WhiteHat** integration tile and click it.
3.  Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

*   Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this WhiteHat
    account in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
    `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
*   Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
    the integration instance.
*   Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
    needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
*   Enter the **API Key** used to authenticate with WhiteHat.

4.  Click **Create Configuration** once all values are provided.

### Relationships

#### Intra-Instance

| From                     | Type           | To                       |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `whitehat_account`       | **HAS**        | `whitehat_scan`          |
| `whitehat_scan`          | **IDENTIFIED** | `whitehat_vulnerability` |
| `whitehat_vulnerability` | **EXPLOITS**   | `cwe`                    |
| `whitehat_finding`       | **IS**         | `whitehat_vulnerability` |

#### Extra-Instance / Mapped

| From                           | Type        | To                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CodeRepo/Project/Application` | **HAS/HAD** | `whitehat_finding` <br> Note: This is mapped automatically only when the name of the Whitehat Application the finding belongs to matches the name of a CodeRepo/Project/Application in JupiterOne. |
