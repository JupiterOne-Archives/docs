# Checkmarx

## Checkmarx + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize Checkmarx scan assessments and findings on projects in the
  JupiterOne graph.
- Visualize Checkmarx teams in the JupiterOne graph.
- Map a Checkmarx team to connected users in JupiterOne.
- Monitor Checkmarx findings within the alerts app.
- Monitor changes to Checkmarx projects using JupiterOne alerts.

**NOTE**: The Checkmarx integration currently ingests the _latest_ project scan
information. If the _latest_ project scan has status "Failed," then the
integration will also fetch the last _successful_ Checkmarx project scan.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches teams, assessments, and new findings from
  Checkmarx to update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
- Configure alerts to reduce the noise of findings.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires the hostname of the Checkmarx instance along with a user's
  username and password.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Support

If you need help with this integration, please contact
[JupiterOne Support](https://support.jupiterone.io).

## Integration Walkthrough

The integration connects directly to Checkmarx SAST API.

### In Checkmarx

1. Capture the **Hostname** of the Checkmarx instance.
2. Create a new service account user or leverage an existing user that has read
   access to your Checkmarx account.

### In JupiterOne

1. From the top navigation of the J1 Search homepage, select **Integrations**.
2. Scroll to the **Checkmarx** integration tile and click it.
3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

- Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this Checkmarx
  account in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
  `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
- Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
  the integration instance.
- Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
  needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.
- Enter the **Client Username** of the Checkmarx user to authenticate with.
- Enter the **Client Password** of the Checkmarx user to authenticate with.
- Enter the **Client Hostname** of the Checkmarx instance.
