# Sentry Integration with JupiterOne

## Sentry + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize Sentry services, teams, and users in the JupiterOne graph.
- Map Sentry users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
- Monitor changes to Sentry users using JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches organizations, projects, teams, and users from
  Sentry to update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph, or
  leverage existing queries.
- Configure alerts to take action when JupiterOne graph changes, or leverage
  existing alerts.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires an Auth Token. You need sufficient access in Sentry to
  create an Auth Token with the following scopes:
  - `member:read`
  - `org:read`
  - `project:read`
  - `team:read`
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Integration Walkthrough

### In Sentry

[Sentry API Documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/api/auth/)

[Generate am Auth Token](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/)

1. Navigate to the Auth Tokens page in Sentry Settings.

2. Scroll to the **Sentry** integration tile and click it.
3. Click the **Add Configuration** button and configure the following settings:

- Enter the **Account Name** by which you'd like to identify this Sentry account
  in JupiterOne. Ingested entities will have this value stored in
  `tag.AccountName` when **Tag with Account Name** is checked.
- Enter a **Description** that will further assist your team when identifying
  the integration instance.
- Select a **Polling Interval** that you feel is sufficient for your monitoring
  needs. You may leave this as `DISABLED` and manually execute the integration.

  safe version of your organization and can be found in your Sentry URL at
