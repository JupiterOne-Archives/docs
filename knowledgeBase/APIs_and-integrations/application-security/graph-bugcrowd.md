# Bugcrowd Integration with JupiterOne

## Bugcrowd + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

*   Visualize Bugcrowd bounty programs and submitted findings in the JupiterOne
    graph.
*   Monitor Bugcrowd findings within the alerts app.
*   Monitor changes to Bugcrowd bounty programs using JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

*   JupiterOne periodically fetches changes to programs and new findings from
    Bugcrowd to update the graph.
*   Configure alerts to reduce the noise of submitted findings.

## Requirements

*   JupiterOne requires a Bugcrowd API Token to interact with the API.
*   You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Support
