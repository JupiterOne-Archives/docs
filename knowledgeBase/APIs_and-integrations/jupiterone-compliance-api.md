# Compliance API Endpoints

The following article contains a list of compliance actions from the JupiterOne UI that a user can perform via the graphql API endpoint. 

See the [JupiterOne Platform API](./jupiterone-api.md) for an introduction to the JupiterOne API.

**Base URL**: `https://api.us.jupiterone.io`

**Method**: `POST`

**Endpoint for compliance operations**: `/graphql`

**Rate Limits**: Rate limiting is enforced based on your account tier. A `429` HTTP response code indicates the limit has been reached. The API does not currently return any rate limit headers.

Whenever you make a `POST` request to the `/graphql` endpoint, the associated J1QL query string is a required parameter.

## List Frameworks

This query retrieves a list of all frameworks (benchmarks, compliance standards, questionnaires) that have been added to your JupiterOne account.

**Variables**

- `cursor`: After running the query, a cursor token is returned. This cursor value can be used in the next request to fetch the next page of results.
- `size`: Optional number to specify the number of frameworks you would like to return

**Query**

```graphql
query ListStandards($size: Int, $cursor: String) {
  complianceStandards(size: $size, cursor: $cursor) {
    complianceStandards {
      id
      name
      standard
      accountId
      createTimestamp
      lastUpdatedTimestamp
      filters {
        key
        values
      }
      specDetails {
        version
        type
        webLink
        auditTracking
        hasDomains
        hasSections
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
    }
  }
}
```

## Get Framework

Retrieves a specified framework by id. Includes details such as controls and assignments.

**Variables**

- `id`: The unique identifier of the framework, returned by the `ListStandards` query.

**Query**

```graphql
query ComplianceStandard($id: ID!) {
  complianceStandard(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    standard
    filters {
      key
      values

## Update Review Configurations

The following queries are used to update the review configuration of a framework, section, domain, or requirement/control. Each query requires the ID of the framework you are updating as well as an input variable object, which includes a list of owner emails, the review frequency, and the origin of action links (the domain of your JupiterOne account).

**Variables**

- `complianceStandardId`: The unique identifier for the framework, returned by the `List frameworks` query.
- `input`: The input variable is used to capture additional values, including: the origin of the action link, the owner(s) of the review configuration, and the review frequency. See an example below.

```json
"input": {
  "actionLinkOrigin": "https://j1dev.apps.dev.jupiterone.io",
  "owners": [
    "example@jupiterone.com"
  ],
  "reviewFrequency": "SIXTY_DAYS"
}
```

- `actionLinkOrigin`: Enter the value of your JupiterOne domain
- `owners`: A list of email accounts that have an associated user in JupiterOne.  
- `reviewFrequency`: The frequency that owners will be prompted to review the framework. Valid options include: `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, `SIXTY_DAYS`, `ONE_HUNDRED_EIGHTY_DAYS`, `ANNUALLY`
