# Getting Started with Insights Dashboards

This guide will walk through how to:

1. Import prebuilt Insights Dashboards
1. Create your own custom Insight dashboard

JupiterOne Insights app allows users to build reporting dashboards using J1QL
queries.

Each dashboard can be configured as either a Team board that is shared with
other account users or a Personal board for the individual user. 

The layout of each board is individually saved per user, including the layout
for Team boards, so that each user may configure layouts according to their own
preferences without impacting others. Administrators can save a Team board
layout as "default" for other users.

You can build your own custom dashboards or utilize any of the existing boards
that have already been built.

Here are a few example boards and their configurations:

## 2. Creating a custom Insights dashboard with custom charts based on queries

chart is powered by one or more J1QL queries under the hood.

   you can customize the details of your query/chart, which include, but aren't
   limited to:
   
   - type of visual chart, e.g., number, pie, line, bar, etc.
   - the chart’s query or queries
