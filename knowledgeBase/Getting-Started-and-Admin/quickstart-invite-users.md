# Invite Users to Your J1 Account/Org

Adding others to your JupiterOne account/organization is done via a simple invite
process. To send an invite, follow these steps:

1. Go to ![][1] **Settings**, select ![][2] **Users & Access**.

1. A modal screen should pop up showing the current User Groups. You can add a
   new group by click on the **Add Group** button and give the new group a
   `name` and optionally a `description`.

1. Click on the ![][3] **Add User** button, enter the user's email address, and
   click ![][4] **Send Invitation**.

1. The user should receive an invitation email to join your account/organization
   and be prompted to accept the invite upon login. New users will be prompted
   to create their J1 user account.
