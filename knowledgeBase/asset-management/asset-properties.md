Click the **<** symbol to the left of the asset name to open the extension of the detailed properties side panel. This extended view provides graph visualizations of asset properties such as connected resources, ownership attribution, data access, the Internet path, and open findings. The types of properties shown in the graphs depend on the type of asset.
